Multi-disk systems are designed for these reasons.</p><p>Solution: RAID, redundant array of independent disks</p><p>Problem 1: Load balancing: bandwidth (MB/second) and throughput (IOs/second).</p><p>The problem is that some data is more popular than other data, which is described as load imbalance. I/O requests almost never evenly distributed, but depend on the apps, usage, time. It’s hard to partition static data to evenly distributed IO reqs for hot data changing over time.</p><p>Solution 1.1: stream data from multiple disks in parallel. To deal with hot data, find the right data placement policy</p><ol><li>simple approach: fixed data placement: Data x goes to y.</li><li>better approach: dynamic data placement. Label popular files as <code>hot</code>, separated across multiple disks.</li><li>practical approach: <strong>disk striping</strong>, to distribute chunks of data across multiple disks for large files (relative to stripe unit), good for high-throughput requests. Hot file blocks get spread uniformly.<br><u>The key design decision is picking the strip unit size.</u> To assist alignment, choose multiple of file system block size. If it’s too small, small files will also be spanned across all disks. Extra effort for little benefit. If it’s too large, it’s cost more with striping but no parallel transfers.</li></ol><p>Solution 1.2: concurrent requests to multiple disks</p><p>Problem 2: Fault tolerance: tolerate partial and full disk failures<br>Solution 2.1: store data copies across different disks</p><p>In a independent disk system, all fs on the disk are lost; in a striped system, part of each fs residing on failed disk is lost. Backups can lead to new problems like performance issue and complicate storage provisioning. It is also difficult to do back scheduling.<br>Disk failures in a multi-disk system happen. HDDs fail often (1-13%); SSDs are more reliable (1-3%).</p><p>Solution 2.1.1: Replication.

I have relocated in Berlin and started my job to continue my search in storages. It may seem strange, but I didn’t fully understand the storage system back then, even though I was determined to learn about it. I own many thanks to Stefan and Damien who have walked with me through the journey in QEMU even after I finished Outreachy internship. It was a hard time for me dealing with pandemic control and school matters during last year, for which I am grateful for their companion as not only mentors but also friends with whom I could share something with.</p><p>I am constantly asked why learning CS (computer science) whereas my major in university is biology. I decided to study CS when I was 18. I remember having a conversation with a friend  about the majors we were planning to pursue in university. She chose physics and that’s when I revealed my choice for the first time. It took some turns in the year-over-year self-learning in the university. However, studying biology is not a regretful choice eventually. I must be responsible for all my decisions, right or wrong. And it does not deter me from studying what I set out with. I never believe in the opinion that one must work in the same field as their major studied in school. Not to mention the abundance of excellent open courses available, from which you can learn not only CS, but also gain a deeper understanding of the world and yourself.</p><p>However, I was still in doubt for many years. Will I be able to make it happen that I can work as a software engineer? One question led to another and it builds who I am for finding those answers. Damien was the first one who validated my abilities when I had those doubts and hesitations. And it was the offer of one internship in Japan, which did not happen for a various of reasons in the end, that inspired me to think I could work abroad, starting by not setting limits for myself. That was what in my mind about a year ago.</p><p>I would also thank one of my dearest friend who have supported me even I was not in a good shape. She was there when I made my decision to work abroad and during the long search in possible opportunites. It would have been very difficult for me to cope with the ups and downs without her.</p><p>It was a surprise that my parents took my decision to relocate to Berlin well. I could not come this far without their unconditional love and support.</p><h2><span id="flashback">Flashback</span><a href="#flashback" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><h3><span id="january">January</span><a href="#january" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_0303.jpeg" class title="IMG_0303"><h3><span id="february">February</span><a href="#february" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_0496.jpeg" class title="IMG_0496"><h3><span id="may">May</span><a href="#may" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_1008.jpeg" class title="IMG_1008"><h3><span id="june">June</span><a href="#june" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_1210.jpeg" class title="IMG_1210"><h3><span id="sometime">Sometime</span><a href="#sometime" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_2235.jpeg" class title="IMG_2235"><h3><span id="september">September</span><a href="#september" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>It’s the same day when I received the offical contract and saw the sundown.</p><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_1763.jpeg" class title="IMG_1763"><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_1814.jpeg" class title="IMG_1814"><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_1755.jpeg" class title="IMG_1755"><h3><span id="november">November</span><a href="#november" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_2131.jpeg" class title="IMG_2131"><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_2003.jpeg" class title="IMG_2003"><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_1985.jpeg" class title="IMG_1985"><h3><span id="december">December</span><a href="#december" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_2389.jpeg" class title="IMG_2389"><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_2501.jpeg" class title="IMG_2501"><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_2639.jpeg" class title="IMG_2639"><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_2637.jpeg" class title="IMG_2637"><h2><span id="game">Game</span><a href="#game" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>Baldur’s Gate 3 is my favorite game in this year. It depicts an imaginary world full of adventures, where you can seek the truth amidst a suspicious and uncertain exterior. Though the fight scenes are great, I enjoy playing the Lute with teammates on the top floor of the Elfsong Tavern more.</p><p>I am surprised to find about that the Talos Principle is a very delicate and well designed game. It takes some extra thoughts to pass each level. Every problem you solved will reveal a little more truth of the world that traps you inside. And in the end you are able to choose your path. Maybe a robot overlord? Besides that, Octopath Traveler II is also one of the games that I am crazy about. It’s kind of the game once you pick up and never want to let it go, unless you find the whole stories of all characters. Civilization VI, Mount &amp; Blade I, Breath of the Wild are just classics. I spent many hours to beat old me. IMHO, Breath of the Wild is better than The Tears of The Kindom. It is beautiful and pure as in nature. Though the second one is more advanced in life styles, the previous one touched me with its story lines and the wild without pollution of some ancient relics.</p><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_2682.jpg" class title="IMG_2682"><img src="/sg/2023/12/19/2023/IMG_2683.jpg" class title="IMG_2683"><hr><p>2024 resolution:</p><ul class="task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" id="cbx_0" disabled="true"><label for="cbx_0"> Finish MIT 6-3 self-learning plan (continued)</label></li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" id="cbx_1" disabled="true"><label for="cbx_1"> Pass the probation period</label></li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" id="cbx_2" disabled="true"><label for="cbx_2"> Join in Alpine xxx Summit</label></li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" id="cbx_3" disabled="true"><label for="cbx_3"> German B1or A2</label></li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" id="cbx_4" disabled="true"><label for="cbx_4"> Read 4 books</label></li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" id="cbx_5" disabled="true"><label for="cbx_5"> Visit some national nature parks</label></li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" id="cbx_6" disabled="true"><label for="cbx_6"> See deers in the wild</label></li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" id="cbx_7" disabled="true"><label for="cbx_7"> See the sea</label></li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" id="cbx_8" disabled="true"><label for="cbx_8"> Travel in Iceland</label></li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" id="cbx_9" disabled="true"><label for="cbx_9"> Go to Japan as the graduation trip for missing this year</label></li></ul>]]></content>

And to choose which free block.</p><p>Solution 1:</p><ul><li>Free list: Linked list of free blocks -&gt; simple but performance issues</li><li>Bitmap (common): large array of bits, one per allocatable unit. Two state: free or in use -&gt; better lookup</li><li>Free extent structure (s.t. better): extent is a contiguous range of free blocks -&gt; better management but fragmentation issues</li></ul><p>E.g. Fs storage layout for HDD: FFS 1984<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> has advantages on locality and larger transfer size over pre-FFS fs world. <strong>Allocation groups</strong> are inode and the first data blocks in the same cylinder group, which is also used in modern FSs like xfs 1994, ext*.</p><p>Larger transfer size is meant to amortizing overall positioning costs.</p><ol><li>larger fs block size</li><li>allocate contiguous blocks</li><li>prefetch: fetch more data than requested.

When paying positioning cost once, the trade-off is that a large request can delay requests of normal size. -&gt; heavy streaming of sequential I/O (locality helps)</li></ol><p>Small (&lt;= 8kb, 80%) files are fragmented in real world. And it leads to small I/Os caused by independence of files and levels of indirection.</p><p>Problem 2: small files lead to small I/Os. Need to increase locality and transfer size for small files</p><p>Solution 2: group small files and metadata for larger I/Os.</p><p>How to group?</p><ol><li>Co-locate?</li><li>Over aggressiveness costs little?</li></ol><p>Locality and large transfer size brings performance improvement to fs. The relation between them is prefetching and write-back caching. We don’t want too many random writes. The idea behind all those optimization, I think, is to reduce random access of local file systems. That’s why we  care about cache, fetching data, transferring, etc.</p><p>+Locality:</p><ol><li>delay in cache for r/w</li><li>disk req scheduling for allocation</li><li>write near the disk head (hardly used)</li></ol><p>+large transfer</p><ol><li>re-allocation (move data around)</li><li>pre-allocation (allocate more than you need now)</li><li>extents-like structure as a replacement for block lists and bitmaps (beware of long small-extent lists hiding out)</li></ol><h3><span id="log-structured-fs">Log-structured FS</span><a href="#log-structured-fs" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>-&gt; amortization, large write</p><ul><li>Data and metadata are written sequentially to a circular buffer called log</li><li>shadow paging: write a segment to replace several older smaller blocks and reclaim space.

TableFS (FUSE) packs metadata into LSM trees</p><ol><li>Design: small objects (&lt;= 4kB) are embedded into LSM tree, turning into one large object (~2MB). Large files are stored in object store indexed by tablefs assigned id number.</li><li>LSM tree is a tabular structure with (key, value). It co-locates directory entries with inode attr and small files to reduce random lookups. Readdir performs sequential scan on the table.</li><li>FUSE is a fs in user space. It presents user VFS to the kernel<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</li><li>LevelDB is a key-value database using LSM tree to supports its operations like put, delete, get, scan.</li></ol><h3><span id="co-locating-ffs">Co-locating FFS</span><a href="#co-locating-ffs" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>It allows large transfers by co-locating related metadata and data objs and r/w to obj groups. Files are placed based on name locality, which leads to multiple files per disk I/O.</p><h2><span id="fs-organization">FS organization</span><a href="#fs-organization" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>Vahalia1995 ch8: P255</p><ol><li><p>vnode layer: this layer is for having multiple fs at once. It adds a level of indirection as virtual fs layer. Everything in kernel interacts with fs via a virtualized layer of functions. It can also supprot non-local FSs like NFS, FAT fs,<br>user -&gt; open file object -&gt; vnode_structure</p></li><li><p>dir (inode IDs (file name tranlating to), record len, length of name, file name) is a special file with entries formatted. Sets of entries are organized in block-sized chunks.</p></li><li><p>mount/unmount attach/detach one FS into the namespace.</p></li><li><p>a root file system <code>/</code></p></li><li><p>multiple FSs on one disk. Disk capacity is divided into multiple “partitions”. To track such structure, keep a partition map which has (offset, len) (in logical blocks). Commonly, device drivers handle the partition map (FS req -&gt; partition).</p></li><li><blockquote><p>a symbolic link contains a text string as a path to another file or directory</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Data is declared to be set of records, each a set of fields. Index is a map of key values to offsets in the file. Libarary API in databases allows access by key value or range of values.</p></li></ol><h3><span id="data-organization">Data organization</span><a href="#data-organization" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>The problem of disk organization and naming is how to find certain entry in many environments with TBs of data.</p><ol><li>directory and file structure. Traverse the directory hierairchy by the <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> entries. -&gt; good for moderate-sized data sets</li><li>managing namespace: mount/unmount. Starting with a root file system, mounted fs is attached into this namespace.</li></ol><p>Difficulty with dir hierarchies:</p><ol><li>difficult to scale to large size</li><li># of entries in a dir grows too large -&gt; partition into subdirectories again</li><li>one data object fits into many places -&gt; different file names for the same data object/put symbolic link to a file</li></ol><p>Naming in two respectives, direct/indirect, absolute/relative. Files are accessed by attributes. Attributes are external information to describe a file, like last modified by, created by, file type etc.</p><h3><span id="open-read-write">Open/read/write</span><a href="#open-read-write" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">fd = open(<span class="string">&quot;foo/bar&quot;</span>, RO);</span><br><span class="line">ret = read(fd, buffer, size);</span><br><span class="line">ret = write(fd, buffer, size)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Open:</p><ol><li>translate file name to inode: <code>vnode_lookup</code>, use dir lookup cache first for each lookup</li><li>create a vnode for inode</li><li>create a open file struct</li><li>fill in fd</li><li>return index into fd table</li></ol><p>Read:</p><ol><li>index into fd table to get a open a open file struct -&gt; get vnode</li><li><code>vnode_read(vnode, offset, buffer, size)</code> -&gt; normal read req</li><li>find vnode’s buffer (offset) in buffer cache</li><li>if buffer is invalid, <code>vnode_getbuf</code> fills it.

If entire buffer will be overwritten by write, the buffer is marked as valid. When  the write copies data to cache buffer, it will also mark buffer dirty. After returning, it leaves buffers as dirty in buffer cache.</p><p>To map file offset to disk LBNs, simple solution is to use start location and a contiguous LBNs to keep entire file. Using a next pointer in each block allows a flexible way to store a file. The most common approach is to use block lists. Block lists are an array with one LBN per block in the file.</p><h3><span id="access-methods">Access methods</span><a href="#access-methods" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>Unix files are generally flat which is a stream of bytes. Databese files are generally indexed with b-tree of records.</p><p>Hash table: O(1) lookup with poor range query. B-tree: O(lgN) lookup with efficient range query.</p><h2><span id="fs-integrity">FS integrity</span><a href="#fs-integrity" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><ol><li>cache benefit = time without cache/time with cache</li><li>average = hit time + (average miss time * miss probability)</li><li>write-back caching: the processor writes data to its local cache firsts before writing that cached data to memory or disk.</li><li>ECC is Error-Correcting Code</li><li>fsync: sync everything associated with that file.</li></ol><h3><span id="disk-block-caching">Disk block caching</span><a href="#disk-block-caching" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>Latency to fetch data or perform I/O on disk from when I/Os are sent from application (on CPUs) can be 5-50 ms, 5-500 times of accessing disk block cache (0.1-1.0 ms) from the same starting place. We need to hide storage latencies or mortize the average response time.</p><p>Problem 1: how to avoid cache misses?</p><p><code>Miss Ratio</code> dominates the avarage access time computation than hit ratio. A cache miss takes much slower than a cache hit. It can be seen in the avarage equation.</p><p>Cache misses scenarios:</p><ol><li>among reads: read for which not all data is in cache. Have to go to disk and the reader has to wait. Prefetches go to disk too. Though it do that in the background.</li><li>among writes: writes put new (block-aligned) data into cache and move one. Writers don’t wait unless no cache space is available for new data or it must read existing block because only part set of data being written to disk.</li></ol><h3><span id="internal-consistency">Internal consistency</span><a href="#internal-consistency" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>Problem 2: Challenges to internal consistensy</p><ul><li>concurrent modifications: two processes induce race conditions -&gt; concurrency control</li><li>media defect growth: contents of newly-defective sectors are lost -&gt; redundancy</li><li>transient storage subsystem bug: flipped bits on bus etc -&gt; integrity checks + redundancy</li><li>system crashes are unpredictable and can happen at any time: volatile main memory contents lost. On-disk img must be sufficiently consistent for this type of failures. Only persistent storage is there upon restart. Clean-up must be done after system failures.</li></ul><p>Tools for protecting consistency:</p><ol><li><p>static mapping: if they do not change, they do not cause problems</p></li><li><p>atomicity of writes: checksum or per-server ECC provides per-sector with unwritten guarantee by FS/app. -&gt; good for grouping inter-related updates, like directory chunks and inodes</p><p>Problem 2.1: data is lost when write is partially completed</p></li><li><p>update ordering: ensure that one update propagates before another -&gt; good for single-direction dependencies</p><p>Problem 2.2: not good for bidirectional dependencies (most of them in fs)</p><p>Solution 2.2: convert some of them to single direction giving importance of direction.</p></li><li><p>atomicity: ensure that a set of updates all occur or none do</p></li></ol><p>Purpose of update ordering: provide integrity of metadata pointers in face of system failures</p><p>Basic rules are like rules of programming with pointers. Allocate before use, must free when deallocating, set new pointer before free when moving. In pointer world, freeing means nullifying. Something always left dangling if there is a badly-timed crash.</p><h3><span id="crash-recovery">Crash recovery</span><a href="#crash-recovery" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>Tradional way examines entire contents by walking entire dir hierarchy and each file’s block list, indentify and rebuild free space/inode bitmaps.

      <title>Not Exatcly About NVMe ZNS Emulation</title>
      <link href="/sg/2023/09/22/qemu_zns/"/>
      <url>/sg/2023/09/22/qemu_zns/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog is the second part of NVMe ZNS emulation. You can find the first one on this link: <a href="https://sgzerolc.github.io/sg/2023/01/14/qemu_nvme/">A Tour of NVMe</a>.</p><p>First, the tour continues by discussing the hanging questions and introducing the latest solutions to metadata persistence. Second, we delve into address translation and elaborate on the details of ZNS metadata on NVMe device side. Afterward, we will shift our focus away from NVMe and briefly explore Linux cluster storage.</p><p>There were several approaches to persistence when Dimtry contributed ZNS emulation<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. The one I apply is to add a separate blockdev which stores the zoned metadata in the Qcow2 image. Qcow2 is better than Raw format for its popularity in virtual image format.</p><p>Another way is using a separate hostmem/mmap’ed file. However, the QEMU block layer does not support mmap. A BlockDriverState might not have a file descriptor that can be mapped.</p><h2><span id="qcow2-full-emulation">Qcow2 full emulation</span><a href="#qcow2-full-emulation" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>Qcow2 is a storage format for virtual disks. Zoned storage emulation is added as a new format extension to the Qcow2 driver. Thereby users can attach such a Qcow2 image file to the guest os as a zoned device.</p><p>The zone state machine depicts state transitions and zone resources<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. Read only and offline states are caused by device internal events, which is ignored in full emulation for simplicity. The other zone states contain empty, full, open and closed states. If the guest or QEMU crashes, the zone states are needed to recover. In real devices, open states (explicit open, implicit open) will lost and turn into closed state after a power cycle. Meanwhile, write pointers should be preserved to track usable blocks within the zone.</p><p>We need to think of a way to maintain zone states correctly and guarantee zoned metadata persistence. Write pointer is an array of unsigned 64-bit intergers. Even though it can store zone information that has few bits like zone state, in-memory zone state is good enough to serve its purpose without extra cost on state assignment to write pointers. Without loss of active zones, Qcow2 keeps track of active states in doubly linked lists. When reading zone states, it will first check if the zone is in each zone list and check wp when finding none.</p><figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="title">Qcow2Wp</span> &#123;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="type">uint64_t</span> wp;</span><br><span class="line">    QLIST_ENTRY(Qcow2Wp) exp_open_zone_entry;</span><br><span class="line">    QLIST_ENTRY(Qcow2Wp) imp_open_zone_entry;</span><br><span class="line">&#125; Qcow2Wp;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="title">BDRVQcow2State</span> &#123;</span></span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">/* States of zoned device */</span></span><br><span class="line">    Qcow2ZonedHeaderExtension zoned_header;</span><br><span class="line">    QLIST_HEAD(, Qcow2Wp) exp_open_zones;</span><br><span class="line">    QLIST_HEAD(, Qcow2Wp) imp_open_zones;</span><br><span class="line">    Qcow2Wp *wp;</span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line"> &#125; BDRVQcow2State;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Another kind of in-memory state is zone resources. It has open and active zone limits to affect zone operations. Write requests on zones no longer excute when any one of the zone limits is over. If there is room left for active zones, the device can implicitly close one zone (implicit open) to avoid exceeding open zone limit.</p><h2><span id="zns-metadata-persistence">ZNS metadata persistence</span><a href="#zns-metadata-persistence" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>ZNS emulation is fully compiant with the NVMe ZNS spec except persistent zone states. We can add persistence to the metadata of ZNS emulation by taking advantage of new block layer APIs and the Qcow2 image as backing file. It divides into two parts, zone states and ZDED (zone descriptor extension data) which is one of zone attribute fields.</p><h3><span id="address-translation">address translation</span><a href="#address-translation" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>NVMe device internal memory stores data directly from the guest depending on where the io_queues are stored, host or NVMe device. Normally, the guest address will be translated to host address. But if it’s DMA (direct memory access), the guest cannot map the address and will trigger a bouce buffer. The host will trap it asking if Nvme device knows about it. CMB (controller memory buffer) and PMR (persistent memory region) are designed for data mapping there. PMR always persistents even the crashes. It can resume the writes. Only one bounce buffer in flight is trapped.</p><figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="type">static</span> <span class="keyword">inline</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="title function_">nvme_blk_zone_append</span><span class="params">(BlockBackend *blk, <span class="type">int64_t</span> *offset,</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="params">                                  <span class="type">uint32_t</span> align,</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="params">                                  BlockCompletionFunc *cb,</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="params">                                  NvmeZoneCmdAIOCB *aiocb)</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    NvmeRequest *req = aiocb-&gt;req;</span><br><span class="line">    assert(req-&gt;sg.flags &amp; NVME_SG_ALLOC);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> (req-&gt;sg.flags &amp; NVME_SG_DMA) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        req-&gt;aiocb = dma_blk_zone_append(blk, &amp;req-&gt;sg.qsg, (<span class="type">int64_t</span>)offset,</span><br><span class="line">                                         align, cb, aiocb);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125; <span class="keyword">else</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        req-&gt;aiocb = blk_aio_zone_append(blk, offset, &amp;req-&gt;sg.iov, <span class="number">0</span>,</span><br><span class="line">                                         cb, aiocb);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3><span id="zone-attribute-zrwa-zded">zone attribute: ZRWA, ZDED</span><a href="#zone-attribute-zrwa-zded" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>The ZRWA (zone random write area) is a legacy bit for adaption.

id="flow-control">Flow control</span><a href="#flow-control" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>Problem: Implement flow control for the bios in the md block device (or any other block device like null block driver) in Linux kernel</p><p>Bio is the unit to map data in the memory to generic block offset. Block device drivers receive requests or I/Os from I/O scheduler. The scheduler groups bios to requests and use a multi-queue machanism to dispatch events. Device mapper is on top of I/O scheduler. DM receives BIOs from the user/fs and remap them first according to the DM properties.</p><p>First, look into the null_blk driver. In flight BIO is an operation that has been requested, but hasn’t been initiated yet. The shared resources in flow control are in-flight BIOs. The invariants of flow control for the bios in the null_blk driver are:</p><ol><li>Increasing: If the # of in-flight bios &gt;= high, the thread that is processing bio will be blocked</li><li>Decreasing: If the # of in-flight bios &lt; low, the blocked threads will continue executing.</li></ol><p>Secendly, the null_blk driver receives requests from mq block layer or IOs directly. The request queue model and IO queue model will both handle the BIOs through *_handle_cmd and finish BIOs through *_complete_cmd. Zoned commands are part of processing IO and can be ignored as the other processing part.</p><p>Intuitively, there are two choices to add locking for null_blk driver:</p><ol><li>When the amount of blocking time is comparably smaller than the thread switching time, use spinlock</li><li>spinlock, semaphore + sleep/wakeup</li><li>sleeplock, atomics</li></ol><p>This patch applies method 2. It can be implemented by atomic ops, waitqueue and spinlock.</p><p>Waitqueue has its disadavantages on the interrupted context. Workqueue is better for handling tasks without openning another thread.</p><p>Finally, cases that increase BIOs are handled in two parts:</p><p>Let n be # of BIO of a req,</p><ol><li>n = 1, bio_in_flight &gt; high</li><li>n + bio_in_flight &gt; high</li></ol><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://embetronicx.com/tutorials/linux/device-drivers/work-queue-in-linux-own-workqueue/">https://embetronicx.com/tutorials/linux/device-drivers/work-queue-in-linux-own-workqueue/</a> <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/736534/">v4.5 block layer</a> <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn3" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="http://books.gigatux.nl/mirror/kerneldevelopment/0672327201/ch13lev1sec3.html">http://books.gigatux.nl/mirror/kerneldevelopment/0672327201/ch13lev1sec3.html</a> <a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn4" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="http://blog.vmsplice.net/2020/04/how-linux-vfs-block-layer-and-device.html">http://blog.vmsplice.net/2020/04/how-linux-vfs-block-layer-and-device.html</a> <a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn5" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/refs/heads/master/labs/block_device_drivers.html#request-queues-multi-queue-block-layer">https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/refs/heads/master/labs/block_device_drivers.html#request-queues-multi-queue-block-layer</a> <a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn6" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/refs/heads/master/labs/block_device_drivers.html#create-and-delete-a-request-queue">https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/refs/heads/master/labs/block_device_drivers.html#create-and-delete-a-request-queue</a> <a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn7" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://xuechendi.github.io/2013/11/14/device-mapper-deep-dive">https://xuechendi.github.io/2013/11/14/device-mapper-deep-dive</a> <a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section>]]></content>

Though the receiver has received the copy of packet 2, it needs to ack the sender that it is indeed received. However, it can just discard packet 2 in the second time.</li><li>If the ACK for packet 3 had arrived before the sender’s retransmission of packet 2, could the sender have avoided that retransmission?  (I.e., is there a way for the sender to tell that packet 2 had actually been received?)  No, the sender will still retransmit packet 2.

It may not be able to detect h/w or bugs in s/w or human config errors. Geo-failure are dealt with only if replicas are physically separated.</li><li>Failures in one server are independent from another otherwise it’s useless to use replication.</li><li>Whether replication is worthwhile the N*expense of computing resources depends on the consequences of failures.</li><li>Two main approaches:<ul><li>state transfer: primary sends internal memory (state) to backup</li><li>replicated state machine: clients send operations to primary and primary sends those external events to backups. All replicas have deterministic same state as primary if execute the operations in the same order.</li></ul></li><li>tradeoffs:<ul><li>state transfer is simpler but may be large and slow to transfer over network</li><li>replicated state machine are comparably smaller than state and generates less network traffic but complex to get right.</li></ul></li><li>example: VM-FT uses replicated state machine on single-core processor.

That is, is it possible that if the primary and the backup end up in different network partitions that the backup will become a primary too and the system will run with two primaries?</p><p>There will be only one primary executing in network partitions. The primary VM may not send an output to the external world until the backup receives and acknowledges the log entry associated with the operation. When network partitions happen, the primary cannot get a response from the backup and the backup cannot get a heartbeat from the primary. Either failures occur to the servers or network connectivity is lost.</p><p>VM-FT hence performs an atomic op test-and-set on shared storage that stores the virtual disks of vms when the primary or the backup wants to go live.If the op suceeds, then the vm is allowed to go live. If not, that means a vm must have been live, so the current vm halts itself. If the vm cannot access shared storage, it just waits until it can.</p><img src="/sg/2023/07/28/ds_basics/Screenshot-0937373.png" class title="Screenshot-0937373"><h2><span id="raft">Raft</span><a href="#raft" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>Readings:</p><ol><li>Raft (2014): In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm (Extended Version)</li></ol><h3><span id="raft-elections">Raft elections</span><a href="#raft-elections" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><h3><span id="log-handling">log handling</span><a href="#log-handling" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><h3><span id="raft-persistence">Raft persistence</span><a href="#raft-persistence" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><h3><span id="client-behavior">client behavior</span><a href="#client-behavior" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><h3><span id="snapshots">snapshots</span><a href="#snapshots" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><h2><span id="case-study-zookeeper-2010">case study: ZooKeeper 2010</span><a href="#case-study-zookeeper-2010" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>case study:</p><h2><span id="chain-replication">chain replication</span><a href="#chain-replication" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><h2><span id="case-study-cr-2004">case study: cr 2004</span><a href="#case-study-cr-2004" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><h2><span id="distributed-transations">distributed transations</span><a href="#distributed-transations" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><h2><span id="case-study-scalable-dfs-1997">case study: scalable dfs 1997</span><a href="#case-study-scalable-dfs-1997" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><h2><span id="case-study-spanner-2012">case study: spanner 2012</span><a href="#case-study-spanner-2012" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><h2><span id="case-study-optimistic-concurrency-control-2015">case study: optimistic concurrency control 2015</span><a href="#case-study-optimistic-concurrency-control-2015" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><h2><span id="case-study-spark-2012">case study: spark 2012</span><a href="#case-study-spark-2012" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><h2><span id="case-study-scaling-memcache-at-facebook-2013">case study: scaling memcache at Facebook 2013</span><a href="#case-study-scaling-memcache-at-facebook-2013" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><h2><span id="case-study-causal-consistency-2011">case study: causal consistency 2011</span><a href="#case-study-causal-consistency-2011" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><h2><span id="case-study-sundr-2004">case study: SUNDR 2004</span><a href="#case-study-sundr-2004" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2>]]></content>

      <title>A Tour of NVMe</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Content: NVMe Specification (Section 2-2.2.1 [p15-p19] + Section 3.3.1 [p79-p83]), NVMe-tutorial (slides 1-11)</p><p>Recently, I’ve been working on making the metadata for QEMU NVMe ZNS emulation persistent across QEMU restarts. The state of namespace zones does not persist and will reverse to the empty state once QEMU is restarted. With the support of mentors in QEMU community through weekly discussions, my searching graph for this task is as follows:</p><ol><li><p>What is this task and why? I’ve read a little related work about NVMe emulation metadata: 1) Dmitry Fomichev<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> , use another file to store metadata for NVMe ZNS emulation. If the file is not specified, then the metadata is not persistent as before; 2)  Klaus Jensen<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>, the metadata for NVMe emulation is stored at the end of the namespace backing block device.</p><p>(I didn’t quite understand NVMe-specific things mentioned in the source code back then)</p><p>-&gt; read about NVMe ZNS spec, NVMe spec, slides, tutorials</p></li><li><p>How to design?  Two ways: 1) extensible design: use feature bits, which can represent different zone descriptors or APIs, 2) use different sets of interfaces. The things I was not clear were the aim for an interface. Now I think it means to unify interfaces for necessary cases. Regarding to zoned storage emulation, there are three cases supposed to take in considerations, zoned emulation, full emulation and NVMe ZNS emulation. Think about the design semantically and have a thorough plan through discussion before implementing anything. As it goes further, designing skeleton must be based on the implementations in source code. It reminds me of the idea Damien talked about for zone append command of zoned format driver. Different from the way in file-posix driver where append write command emulates through regular write and wp array model, a new approach could be something similar to <code>file append</code>. The old way still works but a new method can bring more insights.</p><p>? <u>However, I didn’t think through the relation between file append and zone append write…</u></p></li><li><p>What NVMe ZNS emulation in QEMU can emulate and how much of that is doable with the new zoned.c block driver? This question was brought out in the first week of metadata design discussion by Stefan. I was unable to answer it until further looking into spec and source code.</p><p>-&gt; Existing NVMe ZNS metadata support</p><p>-&gt; How to make file-posix and zoned format driver as underlying storage of NVMe ZNS devices?</p><p>-&gt; Consider supporting persistent metadata for one zoned namespace before enabling multiple zoned namespaces.</p></li><li><p>Very naive design of the task. Checks and new problems.</p><p>Store the metadata (write pointers and configurations) at the end of the zoned namespace.</p><p>-&gt; Where to put the metadata inside the disk? I am not favored to use another file to store metadata for each namespace. Could it lead to one namespace with one file or N namespaces with one file?</p></li><li><p>Review for debugging zoned emulation. New tests. Think back to the command line for zoned emulation with considerations of real applications use QEMU. (Going back to the starting point)</p></li><li><p>Stuck at the 4th step. What’s the next step to implement? Found the gap…</p></li></ol><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2020-06/msg00738.html">https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2020-06/msg00738.html</a> <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://gitlab.eduxiji.net/duskmoon314/qemu/-/commit/bc3a65e99254cfe001bd16a569a5aa7d20f930e8">https://gitlab.eduxiji.net/duskmoon314/qemu/-/commit/bc3a65e99254cfe001bd16a569a5aa7d20f930e8</a> <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section>]]></content>

和大环境普遍的裁员及经济萧条，再加上国内也没有多少和存储相关的岗位，我越来越厌烦找工作和前期拟合准备。对比起来，ng 直接找国外工作的难度几乎和从国内找差不多了，因为都不怎么招人。那为什么不继续做想做的事？而如果想要在国际市场上有普遍的竞争力，我必须完成明年日本的至少两个月的实习或足够的课程项目。</p><h2><span id="kai-yuan-chu-tan">开源初探</span><a

 “There will be times when the struggle seems impossible.

Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they’ve already enlisted in the cause. Remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward. And then remember this. The Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear.

QEMU hasn’t directly supported ZBDs before so this article explains how they work and why QEMU needed to be extended.</p><h2><span id="zoned-block-devices">Zoned block devices</span><a href="#zoned-block-devices" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>Zoned block devices (ZBDs) are divided into regions called zones that can only be written sequentially. By only allowing sequential writes, SSD write amplification can be reduced by eliminating the need for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_translation_layer">Flash Translation Layer</a>, and potentially lead to higher throughput and increased capacity. Providing a new storage software stack, zoned storage concepts are standardized as <a href="https://zonedstorage.io/docs/introduction/smr#governing-standards">ZBC (SCSI standard), ZAC (ATA standard)</a>, and <a href="https://zonedstorage.io/docs/introduction/zns">ZNS (NVMe)</a>. Meanwhile, the virtio protocol for block devices(virtio-blk) should also be aware of ZBDs instead of taking them as regular block devices. It should be able to pass such devices through to the guest. An overview of necessary work is as follows:</p><ol><li>Virtio protocol: <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/914377/">extend virtio-blk protocol with main zoned storage concept</a>, Dmitry Fomichev</li><li>Linux: <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-block/msg91944.html">implement the virtio specification extensions</a>, Dmitry Fomichev</li><li>QEMU: <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2022-10/msg05195.html">add zoned storage APIs to the block layer</a>, Sam Li</li><li>QEMU: implement zoned storage support in virtio-blk emulation, Sam Li</li></ol><p>Once the QEMU and Linux patches have been merged it will be possible to expose a virtio-blk ZBD to the guest like this:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">-blockdev node-name=drive0,driver=zoned_host_device,filename=/path/to/zbd,cache.direct=on \</span><br><span class="line">-device virtio-blk-pci,drive=drive0 \</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>And then we can perform zoned block commands on that device in the guest os.</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"># blkzone report /dev/vda</span><br><span class="line">start: 0x000000000, len 0x020000, cap 0x020000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 0(nw) [type: 1(CONVENTIONAL)]</span><br><span class="line">start: 0x000020000, len 0x020000, cap 0x020000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 0(nw) [type: 1(CONVENTIONAL)]</span><br><span class="line">start: 0x000040000, len 0x020000, cap 0x020000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 0(nw) [type: 1(CONVENTIONAL)]</span><br><span class="line">start: 0x000060000, len 0x020000, cap 0x020000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 0(nw) [type: 1(CONVENTIONAL)]</span><br><span class="line">start: 0x000080000, len 0x020000, cap 0x020000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 0(nw) [type: 1(CONVENTIONAL)]</span><br><span class="line">start: 0x0000a0000, len 0x020000, cap 0x020000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 0(nw) [type: 1(CONVENTIONAL)]</span><br><span class="line">start: 0x0000c0000, len 0x020000, cap 0x020000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 0(nw) [type: 1(CONVENTIONAL)]</span><br><span class="line">start: 0x0000e0000, len 0x020000, cap 0x020000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 0(nw) [type: 1(CONVENTIONAL)]</span><br><span class="line">start: 0x000100000, len 0x020000, cap 0x020000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 1(em) [type: 2(SEQ_WRITE_REQUIRED)]</span><br><span class="line">start: 0x000120000, len 0x020000, cap 0x020000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 1(em) [type: 2(SEQ_WRITE_REQUIRED)]</span><br><span class="line">start: 0x000140000, len 0x020000, cap 0x020000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 1(em) [type: 2(SEQ_WRITE_REQUIRED)]</span><br><span class="line">start: 0x000160000, len 0x020000, cap 0x020000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 1(em) [type: 2(SEQ_WRITE_REQUIRED)]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2><span id="zoned-emulation">Zoned emulation</span><a href="#zoned-emulation" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>Currently, QEMU can support zoned devices by virtio-scsi or PCI device passthrough. It needs to specify the device type it is talking to. Whereas storage controller emulation uses block layer APIs instead of directly accessing disk images. Extending virtio-blk emulation avoids code duplication and simplify the support by hiding the device types under a unified zoned storage interface, simplifying VM deployment for different types of zoned devices. Virtio-blk can also be implemented in hardware. If those devices wish to follow the zoned storage model then the virtio-blk specification needs to natively support zoned storage. With such support, individual NVMe namespaces or anything that is a zoned Linux block device can be exposed to the guest without passing through a full device.</p><p>For zoned storage emulation, zoned storage APIs support three zoned models (conventional, host-managed, host-aware) , four zone management commands (Report Zone, Open Zone, Close Zone, Finish Zone), and Append Zone. The QEMU block layer has a BlockDriverState graph that propagates device information inside block layer. File-posix driver is the lowest level within the graph where zoned storage APIs reside.</p><p>After receiving the block driver states, Virtio-blk emulation recognizes zoned devices and sends the zoned feature bit to guest. Then the guest can see the zoned device in the host. When the guest executes zoned operations, virtio-blk driver issues corresponding requests that will be captured by viritio-blk device inside QEMU. Afterwards, virtio-blk device sends the requests to file-posix driver which will perform zoned operations using Linux ioctls.</p><p>Unlike zone management operations, Linux doesn’t have a user API to issue zone append requests to zoned devices from user space. With the help of write pointer emulation tracking locations of write pointer of each zone, QEMU block layer can perform append writes by modifying regular writes. Write pointer locks guarantee the execution of requests. Upon failure it must not update the write pointer location which is only got updated when the request is successfully finished.</p><p>Problems can always be solved with right mind and right tools. A good approach to avoid pitfalls of programs is test-driven. In the beginning, users like qemu-io commands utility can invoke new block layer APIs. Moving towards to guest, existing tools like blktests, zonefs-tools, and fio are introduced for broader testing. Depending on the size of the zoned device, some tests may take long enough time to finish. Besides, tracing is also a good tool for spotting bugs. QEMU tracking tools and blktrace monitors block layer IO, providing detailed information to analysis.</p><h2><span id="starting-the-journey-with-open-source">Starting the journey with open source</span><a href="#starting-the-journey-with-open-source" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>As a student interested in computer science, I am enthusiastic about making real applications and fortunate to find the opportunity in this summer. I have a wonderful experience with QEMU where I get chance to work with experienced engineers and meet peers sharing same interests. It is a good starting point for me to continue my search on storage systems and open source projects.</p><p>Public communication, reaching out to people and admitting to failures used to be hard for me. Those feelings had faded away as I put more effort to this project over time. For people may having the same trouble as me, it might be useful to focus on the tasks ahead of you instead of worrying about the consequences of rejections from others.</p><p>Finally, I would like to thank Stefan Hajnoczi, Damien Le Moal, Dmitry Fomichev, and Hannes Reinecke for mentoring me - they have guided me through this project with patience and expertise, when I hit obstacles on design or implementations, and introduced a fun and vibrant open source world for me. Also thank QEMU community and Outreachy for organizing this program.</p><h2><span id="conclusion">Conclusion</span><a href="#conclusion" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>The current status for this project is waiting for virtio specifications extension and Linux driver support patches got accepted. And the up-to-date patch series of zoned device support welcome any new comments.</p><p>The next step for zoned storage emulation in QEMU is to enable full zoned emulation through virtio-blk. Adding support on top of a regular file, it allows developers accessing a zoned device environment without real zoned storage hardwares. Furthermore, virtio-scsi may need to add full emulation support to complete the zoned storage picture in QEMU. QEMU NVMe ZNS emulation can also use new block layer APIs to attach real zoned storage if the emulation is used in production in future.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Update in 05/21/2023: It’s strange how things turn out to be like this. I have continued to contribute to the project with QEMU’s mentors’ help till now. In all those dark days of the last year, it’s something that gives me strength to go forward.</p><hr><p>Fun fact, I learned the word CAREER as a junior high student and I mistook it for car. Ok, it’s off-topic.</p><p>What you want to do in the five years is a not easy question to answer for most people and so am I. At this stage, I am still trying things and find out what I like according to the experience. Luckily, I grow an interest in open source projects during this internship and decide to take further investigation on storage systems<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> afterwards. That leads to my answer. I would like to be an infrastructure engineer in storage systems and keep working on the open source projects.</p><h2><span id="reality-reviews">Reality reviews</span><a href="#reality-reviews" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>Generally, finding a job in CN is really difficult nowadays due to the pandemic and global economic recession. And finding a job with work life balance is even harder. Less job positions, more people. The situation can get worse in future because of various reasons. I do wish everyone can find the job they like.</p><p>Database is a hot spot and many companies work on it including most of the big domestic techs and several start-ups. As for the jobs related to storages that I know of, excluding the database techs, the handful techs open such positions like ByteDance, databend.</p><p>Finding a job abroad as graduates is a different question to ponder. A friend told me it’s difficult but possible and gave me some examples succeed. So I will at least send a resume when I am ready for such interviews.</p><h2><span id="personal-review">Personal review</span><a href="#personal-review" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>I always ask myself one question for those years: Can I do it?  I jumped into the university with the naive belief that I can study computer science by myself. It turns out way harder than I think :) However, studying open courses is fun as you learn more about it. My current goal is to finish some course projects left for so long. It is only for practice purpose since it’s more like toy project.</p><p>On the other side, I’ve become more confident to take the road I choose. There are some constraints that should not exist not only in school but also in work. In my school, one of the constraints that will not satisfy the threshold of transferring to Computer Science related majors is GPA lower than 3.6(4.0). The list can go on and on. However, I don’t think it can hide people’s interests and passion. What defines who we are, I think, is the actions taken and thoughts to change.</p><h2><span id="later-on">Later on</span><a href="#later-on" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>I will be graduated in June in 2023 and plan to work since then. What I am interested is open source jobs related to system programming and storages. Hope I can make it :)</p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>I am not sure “storage system” is a defined word but it is in this <a href="https://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece746/schedule.html">course page</a> so I just go with it. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section>]]></content>

      <title>Zoned Storage Emulation So Far</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looking back to what I’ve accomplished so far, it is quite a journey. As for the original internship project timeline, I was thinking about the timeline too naively and took no regard of difficulty of certain project task.</p><p>For the rest of the internship, the major goal is to finish the first part of the original proposal - Extending zoned storage emulation support in virtio-blk device - and get it merged. Besides, I think it’s possible to finish part two - Adding support to NVMe ZNS for guest driver testing - before the project ends. Maybe not if unexpected issues appear :)</p><p>If I were starting the project over, I would ask questions earlier rather than get stuck at sth for a really long time. It’s important to ask questions, which is a way to investigate more and find out what is wrong or unknown. I read several PPT slides about the block device and QEMU structure, zoned storage website, and codes in virtio-blk.c etc before the internship begins. It’s not very helpful because I did not know what to ask at first.</p><p>What I’ve done in last two months is finishing the most of zoned storage emulation, except zone append emulation part. One project task took longer than expected is the zone report emulation. It bothers me that I’ve taken this long to have a simple workable version. At first, I thought it’s a three-week task after talking to my mentors about the developing plan in the first week. However, I have underestimated a lot of details that can mostly be spotted only during the implementations. Going through the major issues in the last several weeks, I found that:</p><ol><li>set up a full guest VM. &lt;1 week&gt;</li><li>no fake zones -&gt; Use real zoned device information.(methods switching)/right way to test &lt;1 week&gt;</li><li>errors when booting the guest os(driver side, kernel side) -&gt; no errors, the guest os gets stuck &lt;2 weeks&gt;</li><li>fix the issue of the zoned feature bit &lt;1 week&gt;</li></ol><p>The most interesting I’ve learned so far is to get the device communicate with the guest driver so that the zone report emulation can work. My mentors helped me a lot during the debugging process where I’ve learned incrementally about what happens exactly in both device side and driver side.</p>]]></content>

The project I’ve been working on is adding zoned device support in virtio-blk emulation<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p><p>QEMU is a big project which looks a bit intimidating at first (and afterward :). It’s also lots of fun investigating different parts to solve problems in the way. Sometimes, I feel like a lousy detective trying to figure out how things fit together. Luckily, my mentors in this project always give me a hand when I am stuck at wrong directions.</p><h2><span id="brief-introduction">Brief introduction</span><a href="#brief-introduction" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th>Terminology</th><th>Abbr.</th><th>Concept</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shingled Magnetic Recording</td><td>SMR</td><td>write data in zones of overlapped tracks</td></tr><tr><td>Perpendicular/Conventional Magnetic Recording</td><td>PMR/CMR</td><td>write data in discrete tracks</td></tr><tr><td>write pointer</td><td>WP</td><td>it points to the lowest LBA(Logic Block Address) that have not been written of that zone</td></tr><tr><td>sequential write required</td><td>SWR</td><td>Host Managed Model(HM): write operations must be sequential</td></tr><tr><td>sequential write preferred</td><td>SWP</td><td>Host Aware Model(HA): unconstrained writes possible</td></tr><tr><td>open zone resource</td><td>OZR</td><td>the open zone resource in a zone block device is limited</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span id="zoned-storage">Zoned storage</span><a href="#zoned-storage" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>Imagining the shingle in the roof, SMR writes data in a similar overlapping manner.  BY removing the gaps, more data tracks placing on each magnetic surface reflects in wider write head of design. The recording head will advance partial width of one data track after a write. Such overlapping tracks are grouped into zones. The gaps between zones prevents data overwrite from write head changing from one zone to another. (Ignoring-physics version)</p><p>What we want to take advantage of SMR in the project is the SWR property. For example, if LBA <code>x</code>, <code>x+a</code> is in zone 1, we can’t write <code>x+a</code> after write <code>x</code> because it is potentially under another zone. The area dencity of SMR results in higher disk capacity, better erasure coding, reducing adjacent-track interference exposure. Meanwhile, SMR also supports random read like CMR. Therefore SWR is good fro data detection and recovery.</p><img src="/sg/2022/07/05/qemu_pj_intro/Screenshot-4060048.png" class title="HDD drives"><p>The main purpose of zoned storage emulation is to let VM Guest OS see a zoned block device file on the Host OS. However QEMU sees the zoned device as regular block device right now. Meanwhile, I should enable guest driver testing in NVMe ZNS so we can test if our previous works and benchmark it, which would be a nice topic for another blog(once I figure out how benmarking works :)</p><p>The cool vision about this project is to enable zoned storage on a regular file. It means VM Guest OS can see a regular file as zoned block device file, which is helpful for development related to zoned storage on a machine without such support. Whereas I have some doubts about the overhead and design of such improvement. For example, why should we emulate such zoned device if it maybe not offer enough performance for using? Again, another topic saving later.</p><img src="/sg/2022/07/05/qemu_pj_intro/linux-iopath-3ad49009873f1211b8e873f9ba540a38.png" class title="Linux Zoned block device support overview"><p><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p><h3><span id="virtio-blk-device">Virtio-blk device</span><a href="#virtio-blk-device" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>Virtio-blk device is a storage controller that presents host’s block devices to the guest. The structure of storage layers is designed for extensibility and performance. There is a BlockDriverState graph involved with block layers. BlockBackend provides a interface connecting block drivers to other part like qemu-io or virtio-blk device. It has a root pointer points to other nodes in the BlockDriverState graph. Format node and filter node are above protocal node. It is good for adding a BlockDriver inside the big project.</p><p>The overview of the emulation part is: the guest os sends a request of zoned commands which contains parameters to its virtio-blk driver. Then virtio-blk device receives the request which is basically a big chunk of memory and transforms it to the QEMU’s struct so that block layers can execute correlated commands on the zoned block device. After that, we can transform the results to the guest’s struct and send it back.</p><p>I haven’t though through the performance of virtio-blk device brings in though. Roughly speaking, zoned block devices can offer better performance than regular one especially above HDD level.</p><img src="/sg/2022/07/05/qemu_pj_intro/Screenshot-6787937.png" class title="vm overview"> <h2><span id="zone-state-machine-amp-apis">Zone state machine &amp; APIs</span><a href="#zone-state-machine-amp-apis" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>Zone state machine tracks open zone resource of zoned block devices. Sufficient open zone resource are required for open state in HDD. Zone operations will change states in the write pointer zone models.</p><p>The basic structs of zoned block devices handling is: zone_descriptors, zone_dev, zone_report_struct. Other than the five operations ioctl provides, we would like to add zone append write in the emulation.</p><img src="/sg/2022/07/05/qemu_pj_intro/Screenshot-6799625.png" class title="Block I&#x2F;O stack"><p>​<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>The project idea can be found at <a href="https://wiki.qemu.org/Internships/ProjectIdeas/VirtIOBlkZonedBlockDevices">here</a>. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>The picture is from <a href="https://zonedstorage.io/docs/linux/overview#overview">Damien Le Moal’s website</a>.

      <title>A Vocabulary Term</title>
      <link href="/sg/2022/06/17/outr_vocab/"/>
      <url>/sg/2022/06/17/outr_vocab/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looking back, the first vocabulary term that comes to mind is “building from source.” Throughout the application process, I was required to compile a new kernel and library from source. Though I was unfamiliar with the term, I figured it couldn’t be that difficult to look it up on Google.</p><p>The goal of this task is to allow QEMU to use new liburing APIs, which requires a new kernel that supports them. At the start of the application process, I was hesitant to ask the mentors at QEMU. All of them are senior engineers. A stupid question could make me look bad. It would be better if I tried every method I could find first.</p><p>The most difficult problem I encountered was when I thought I understood the issue but facts revealed otherwise. During that time, I had several misunderstandings:</p><ol><li>Debugging the Linux kernel rather than compiling a host kernel.</li><li>Building a gues os image rather than a host kernel from source.</li><li>Researching io uring in QEMU/Linux.</li><li>Installing a liburing package (v2.0) rather than compiling it from source.</li></ol><p>I thought the QEMU development environment was proper. So I moved to next step which is io uring testing. I couldn’t figure out how the testing framework in QEMU fit together. So I attempted to contact Roosh, the former intern working on io uring support in QEMU. Though it can be intimidating to connect with people, I can’t think of a better way to figure out my problems. She was very nice and recommended that I try Fedora Linux, which makes building a kernel much easier.</p><p>The misunderstandings lingered on. After seeking assistance from mentors at QEMU, I finally understood the real issue of the task. The seeking graph was as follows<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">-&gt; gdb/tracing problems? </span><br><span class="line">-&gt; Nope! </span><br><span class="line">-&gt; Kernel problem(#1,#2) found</span><br><span class="line">-&gt; Kernel set.

Still not working</span><br><span class="line">-&gt; Compilation error. </span><br><span class="line">-&gt; Change to newest liburing.git. Working.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>It is difficult to determine whether or not to ask questions. During my internship, I am experiencing the same issue, and my mentors provide me with sound advice. Don’t be afraid to ask if you spend more than an hour researching or debugging something. The sooner we can find problems, the better we will be able to solve them.</p><p>One concern about asking questions at open source events is what we can give back to those who help us all the time. I believe the answer is to do our best to contribute to the community.</p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>The details can be found in my previous blog: <a href="https://sgzerolc.github.io/sg/2022/04/15/qemu-develop/">Begginner’s Guide to Setting up QEMU Devel Env</a>. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section>]]></content>

      <title>Applying to Outreachy</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi there :)</p><p>I’m Sam Li, a Chinese junior student studying computer science on my own. The first two years were especially difficult for me because I had to balance my course plan and school courses, and I had many failures to find the right way to study a CS course. However, along the way, I met several friends who share my interests and we have a lot of fun talking about it. That’s where I first learned about open source organizations, which eventually led me to GSOC and Outreachy.</p><p>It is a great honor for me to be chosen by QEMU for Outreachy 2022, and it is the happiest moment of my life thus far. Besides, I’ve had the best mentors in the world. At the start of the application process, I assumed that this journey would help me develop my characters. Several changes have occurred in my life during the first week of work. I start running again, and I run a little longer each day. Moreover, I have a more consistent schedule for working remotely. In comparison to the time when I was very shy in public speaking, I am now more open to communicating with others. It may not always be very productive. But, thanks to the mentors’ help, I believe I am on the right track.</p><p>There is more to my personality. I enjoy reading history and science fiction. It’s fascinating how history depicts the past while science fiction depicts the future, both of which reflect some reality for the present. Dead Poets Society is my favorite film. I’m always disappointed by the endings and Neil’s fate. Civilization VI is a game that I enjoy playing. It’s a turn-based board game in which you can shape the path of the civilization.</p><p>Authenticity, meaningful work, and adventure are three of my core values.</p><p>My values are built on the foundation of authenticity. Honesty, in my opinion, is the best way to treat people. It’s also how I handle things. I can’t stand untruths and would rather get to the bottom of it. The desire to discover what things really are prevents me from giving up when I face adversity. And here I am, in this project, to learn system programming.</p><p>Meaningful work is also very important to me. What’s the point of doing something if you’re not proud of it? There are various criteria that vary depending on the individual. For me, I’ve discovered an interest in storage systems, and I’ll try to figure out what specific goal I want to achieve in the internship before graduating from university.</p><p>I feel alive when I’m on an adventure. Most of the time, adventure entails risks. I am not interested in following the mainstream, where some people believe that a higher degree automatically solves some life problems, such as the high unemployment rate in these years. So I give up something in order to figure out what I really want to do with my life. It may sound naive, but I really want to see more of the world, either geographically or professionally. I’d like to thank Roosh, Zhi Guo, and all of my mentors Stefan, Damien, Hannes, and Dmitry for their support and guidance along the way, as well as Outreachy for this opportunity.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="toc"><!-- toc --><ul><li><a href="#bei-jing">背景</a></li><li><a href="#jiao-yu">教育</a></li><li><a href="#hun-yin-sheng-yu-chi-hun">婚姻/生育/离婚</a></li><li><a href="#du-li-he-gong-zuo">独立和工作</a></li><li><a href="#qing-gan-guan-xi">情感关系</a></li></ul><!-- tocstop --></div><p>最初接触到这套书还是18年时，断断续续地今天才算看完。我一直对讲述地过于真实的书不忍卒读，这本书把两位主人公莱农（格雷科），莉拉（赛鲁罗）间复杂的友谊刻画地非常有亲切感，我在看这套书时总会发现自己既有莱农的一些特质也有莉拉的一面，书中的文字让我反思这些特点是怎样影响我的世界观的。不仅如此，这套书讲述了一个残酷的关于女性的真相，穿杂的情节即使在现实中发生也不会突兀。那就是女性受到的系统性偏见不会由于阶级的提升而发生改变，无论这个女人是工人阶级，中产阶级还是上流社会，都不可避免地陷入一些特殊的牢笼中，比如教育，生育，家庭暴力，情感关系等。由于我对现实生活中中产阶级及以上的家庭模式不太了解，所以本文的讨论仅限于此书发生的地点年代设想，尽管我怀疑现实中的模式并不会偏离太多。</p><h2><span id="bei-jing">背景</span><a href="#bei-jing" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>主人公出生的地方是二十世纪三四十年代那不勒斯一个破败的社区，所在的家庭都在生存线上挣扎。莱农是家中长女，有一个妹妹，两个弟弟，父亲在市政府做门房。莉拉有个哥哥，父亲是个鞋匠。社区中大多都是这样的家庭，除了卡拉奇家和索拉拉家。卡拉奇家开了肉食店在早期很赚钱，而索拉拉家通过放高利贷和一些灰色产业在整个那不勒斯都横行霸道。</p><img src="/sg/2022/03/03/elena/Screenshot-6311043.png" class title="Screenshot-6311043"><p>她们的友谊互相支撑着彼此走过了很艰难的时刻。尝试着写了几遍但感觉自己的文笔写不出她们之间深刻而充满矛盾的关系，就作罢了。</p><h2><span id="jiao-yu">教育</span><a href="#jiao-yu" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>我认为教育和家庭是人生中最重要的东西，这一点是受苏姿丰那篇演讲的影响也是个人在实践中的体会。然而教育不只代表着学校的教育，我认为教育中最重要的一部分就是自我教育，如果不知道最后的目标具体是什么，那么现在又能有什么支点呢？书中莉拉和莱农接受到的教育是明显不同的，莱农凭借努力考上了当时最有名的学府之一比萨高师，是经过规范训练的大学生；而莉拉小学辍学后就再也没有受到任何正规的教育。我非常敬佩两位主人公的求知欲，莉拉在知道不能在上学后没有自暴自弃而是到社区里唯一一家图书馆用一家四口人的名字借书，之后也陆续学习了拉丁语和希腊语，因为莱农告诉过她初中高中就学这些东西。而在失败的婚姻结束后，她迷上了计算机知识，于是开始学习函授的计算机课程，最后通过技术改变了自己的生活，创立了一家相关的公司。而莱农尽管没有像同学一样显赫的家世，但她一直努力学习着自己欠缺的有力的语言表达能力，思考怎样去有力地组织语言。在父母不同意她去上大学浪费钱时，她坚定地表明了自己的观点。</p><p>然而城区的同龄人并没有这样的幸运，大多数人都是早早辍学。和她们一起长大的女生没能够得到改变的机会，在后来的很多事上只能任人摆布，动辄打骂。当时的索拉拉兄弟经常开着车在城区里找青春期的女生，有女生甚至会羡慕被欺凌的拖进车里的人。只有莉拉知道他们到底会对那个女孩做什么事，并告诉莱农如果她被这么对待一定要叫她。她会划破索拉拉兄弟的喉咙。性教育在社会中普遍是个难以启齿的话题，本来只是了解一些正常的生理常识和手段，但却未能受到家长和学校的重视。想到林奕含发生的悲剧，我至今也没能读完她写的那本书。</p><img src="/sg/2022/03/03/elena/IMG_0236.PNG" class title="IMG_0236"><img src="/sg/2022/03/03/elena/IMG_0237-6316928.PNG" class title="IMG_0237"><h2><span id="hun-yin-sheng-yu-chi-hun">婚姻/生育/离婚</span><a href="#hun-yin-sheng-yu-chi-hun" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>婚姻的本质是一种契约关系，包含权利和义务，虽然社会上常以爱情来矫饰它。我认为没有爱情缔结这样的关系是非常不可靠的，我还认为爱情是一种流动的状态，并不能被婚姻所包括。</p><p>主人公的婚姻都是不同方向的悲剧。莉拉在结婚当天发现温和外表的丈夫下的伪善和暴力，并被婚内强暴，经历了漫长时间的折磨终于抛下一切离开了丈夫。莱农的婚姻或许更常见的被看成一个幸福的婚姻吧。莱农嫁给了一个学阀家族的儿子，离开了破旧的老城区到比萨生活，有独栋房子，丈夫有丰厚的收入。然而事实是她在温吞如水的生活中被母职困住，每天忙着做各种家务事。生孩子养孩子几乎都是莱农一个人在忙，丈夫没有帮助她任何事情，失去了学习和写作的自由。她于是想难道自己上了大学那么多年就是为了做这些事请吗？莱农虽然表面上有精致的生活，有权势大的婆家，有大学教授的丈夫，但是她在繁杂的琐碎家务事中无法做想做的事情。丈夫在小孩刚出生时完全不管，只顾着自己写作看书学习，孩子哭了只能莱农去哄和照顾。这样在如死水的环境里过了很多年。</p><h2><span id="du-li-he-gong-zuo">独立和工作</span><a href="#du-li-he-gong-zuo" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>我一直认为现代女性最重要的一点就是要独立。独立不是指孤立，是指不用依附任何人，在生活中以平等合作的态度对人。而独立离不开工作，工作能产生个人价值，给人一个支点前进。</p><p>莉拉没离开丈夫前只能依附着丈夫存在，直到她离开后找到了一份肉食厂工作她才觉得自己找到了一种长久失去的自由。而莱农长久被困在家庭中不能够继续写作，所写的文字丈夫从来都不会看只是敷衍了事，直到重新开始写作后才理顺了自己的想法，有了更近一步的思考。她们都在生活中逐渐找到了自己的位置，然后开始发明创造。</p><h2><span id="qing-gan-guan-xi">情感关系</span><a href="#qing-gan-guan-xi" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>书中一个很争议的人物就是尼诺。尼诺的虚伪的不同在于他伪装自己成一个关心女性，赞美女性，鼓励女性摆脱压迫的人，实际上他对妻子也是和大多数男性同样的方式。书中和剧里尼诺都展现出帅气有魅力学识的人，但实际上他只是个和他父亲一般虚伪自私的人。书中形容他的才华是没有根基的，他相信权威，是个追名逐利的技术官僚。他可以对任何一个女人——对他有利的——说爱她，然后转头离开后就不闻不问，直到自己哪天需要借用她的帮助再回来。他抛弃过莉拉——当时莉拉以为他们是真心相爱，互相帮助学习的——留下怀孕的莉拉在偏僻的住处里无人问津，他抛弃过一个迷恋他才华的女学生——后来有了一个小孩——之后就完全抛诸脑后了…</p><p>（改天再写）</p>]]></content>

It can affect a system in three aspects: consistency, performance and availability.</p><p>How: A system designer should understand the particular kind of need of clients and how the system operates to decide which consistency guarantee.</p><p>Why: It matters because the system can be the best version for client’s needs, faster without loss of correctness.</p><ul><li><img src="/sg/2022/03/01/recitation_ds/sixcg.png" class title="six consistency guarantees"></li></ul><h3><span id="design-process">Design process</span><a href="#design-process" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><blockquote><p>Data availability is a term used by computer storage manufacturers and storage service providers to describe <strong>how data should be available at a required level of performance in situations ranging from normal through disastrous</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>The paper describes four intermediate consistency protocols between strong consistency and eventual consistency, which gives more flexibility while preserving correctness. Giving the example of baseball game, it lists six peoples to use the data store for different purposes. Here, I will give the reasoning process to the table 2.</p><p>The consitency and performance have inverse correlation. In other words, if the data is more consistent, it means the server which updates the data needs to pass on the new data to every other servers. One server crashed would cause the wrong data got transferred. Therefore strong consistency model has excellent consistency and poor performance and vice versa.</p><p>The four intermediate consistency models can get higher performance than strong consistency due to partial correctness of the data. They don’t need the data in every server is consistent at the same time giving the specific applications providing. Bounded staleness has poor availability as the strong consistency for the same reason of requirement for time. The server can not guarantee the correctness in specific time.</p><ul><li><img src="/sg/2022/03/01/recitation_ds/tradeoffs.png" class title="tradeoffs"></li></ul><h3><span id="baseball-example">Baseball example</span><a href="#baseball-example" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>A baseball game example: minimal consistency of read operation in a simple data store(replicated storage systems) containing only two teams’ scores.</p><ol><li><p>Official scorekeeper: the scorekeeper is the only person to write the data. They need the most updated scores so that strong consistency seems the appropriate one. However they are the only server to write the data and pass on to others. Therefore read my writes would be sufficient.</p></li><li><p>umpire: strong consistency. They can’t provide wrong scores because it’s a fair game.</p></li><li><p>Radio reporter: They need tell the audience a more updated scores than before. Consistent prefix is not enough because they are using scorekeeper’s data and old scores can emerge later than new ones. Therefore it have to maintain the monotonic reads at the same time. Alternatively, monotonic reads with bounded staleness can achieve the same goal.</p></li><li><p>sportswriter: bounded staleness. They need the most updated scores but not in a hurry. So they can wait for the final score at least it is correct one.</p></li><li><p>statistician: for one team’s score, they need strong consistency; for one season’s score, they need read my writes for the same reason as scorekeeper.</p></li><li><p>stat watcher: eventual consistency. It’s ok to provide out-of-date data.</p><img src="/sg/2022/03/01/recitation_ds/line_score.png" class title="line_score"><img src="/sg/2022/03/01/recitation_ds/scores_read.png" class title="scores_read"></li></ol><h3><span id="some-thinking">Some thinking</span><a href="#some-thinking" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><ol><li><p>What systems need weaker consistency? I think the systems that incline to performance and donot heavily rely on real-time computing results such as bank accounts. For example, social media systems like twitter. Updates of tweets are not critical for users.</p></li><li><p>I think understandability is a worthy design goal. If even the developers can hardly understand the protocol, how can they make improvements based on the customer needs and develop relevent features on top of it.</p></li><li><p>To decide on a particular consistency model, I think it requires a thorough study of current target customers and future costs it may bring giving the current design goal. Different cloud storage providers have made different decisions. Amazon S3 uses eventual consistency to improve the performance and availibility<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. It gains more availibility with the proliferation of geo-replicated services.  However Azure aims for specific organizations which needs strong consistency for correctness. I think they are targeting different customer bases.</p></li></ol><h2><span id="raft">Raft</span><a href="#raft" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>What is Raft<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>?</p><p>Raft is a protocol for implementing distributed consensus algorithms so that distributed system can reach agreements having same states. Simply speaking, it’s a way that makes client and its many servers have x = 3 when the client sets x to 3.</p><p>Rules: A Raft cluster has several servers (&gt;=5). A server node has 3 states: follower, candidate, leader. Each node has a log and a state machine.</p><ul><li><p>state machine of servers: an election term</p><img src="/sg/2022/03/01/recitation_ds/state_machine.png" class title="state machine"></li><li><p>Time is split into <code>terms</code>, like logical clocks in Raft.</p></li><li><p>Raft servers communicate through RPCs in parallel. Servers retry RPC if they donot receive a response in a timely manner.</p><ul><li>RequestVote RPCs</li><li>AppendEntries RPCs</li></ul></li></ul><p>Problem 1: a split vote if 2 nodes become candidates at the same time in leader election</p><p>Re-elect until one node becomes leader (receive a <strong>majority</strong> of votes. Majority means over a half of members.). Majority != max.</p><p>Problem 2: network partition in log replication</p><p>The system will reach consensus again when the network partition is healed for following reason. When a node sees the higher election term, it will step down, which means to roll back its uncommitted entries and match the new leader’s log.</p><h3><span id="background">Background</span><a href="#background" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><ol><li><p>Goal of Raft is understandability without losing performance.</p></li><li><p>Backgroud: Paxos, the previous main-stream consensus algorithms, is hard to understand and complicate to maintain the systems built on top of that.</p></li><li><p>Replicated state machine, a replicated log containing the state machine commands from clients. Consensus algorithms usually have properties as: safety (network delay/partition, packet loss, duplication, reordering), availabilty (if a majority of servers in the system is running, the sys can work. The failed ones can work after recovering from state on storage), time irrelevant consistency, <strong>Majority Rules</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Why leave Paxos? Error prone, hard to implement/maintain/understand</p><p>(lol a section to describe why Paxos is so hard)</p><ul><li><p>Single-decree decomposition is hard to maintain replicated log where it separates partial logs of the system and then merges them into one in the end. Consensus algorithms should have constraints on the order of committed logs.</p></li><li><p>Big gap between the theory and real systems in multi-Paxos.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3><span id="flowers-for-algernon">Flowers for Algernon</span><a href="#flowers-for-algernon" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>“纪尼安小姐如果你有机会读到这个请不要为我难过。我很感机我就像你说的得到生命中的弟二次机会。因为我学到很多我以前甚至不知到这世界上真的存在的事情。我很高兴能够看到这些即使只是很短的时间。我很高兴我发现了所有关于我的家人和我的事。好像在我想起他们并且看过他们之前我并没有家人似的但现在我知到我有家人而且我和大家一样也是一个人。“</p><p>“Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind’s eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter life, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light. And he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being, and he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light, there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into the den.” (Plato, The Republic)</p><p>有些常识的人都会记得，眼睛的困惑有两种，也来自两种起因，不是因为走出光明，就是因为走进光明所致，不论是人体的眼睛或心灵的眼睛，都是如此。记得这件事的人，当他们看到别人迷茫、虛弱的眼神，他们不会任意嘲笑，而会先询问这个人的灵魂是否刚从更明亮的生命走出来，因为不适应黑暗而无法看清周遭；或是他刚从黑暗走入光明，因为过多的光芒而目眩。他会认为其中一个人的情况与心境是快乐的，并对另一个人产生怜悯。或是，他可能想嘲笑从幽冥走进光明的灵魂，但这总比嘲笑从光明世界回到黑暗洞穴的人更有道理。(上译)</p><h3><span id="dead-poets-society">Dead Poets Society</span><a href="#dead-poets-society" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion. For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to “glorify God and enjoy him forever.”</p><p>我到林中去，因为我希望谨慎地生活，只面对生活的基本事实，看看我是否学得到生活要教育我的东西，免得到了临死的时候，才发现我根本就没有生活过。我不希望度过非生活的生活，生活是那样的可爱；我却也不愿意去修行过隐逸的生活，除非是万不得已。我要生活得深深地把生命的精髓都吸到，要生活得稳稳当当，生活得斯巴达式的，以便根除一切非生活的东西，划出一块刈割的面积来，细细地刈割或修剪，把生活压缩到一个角隅里去，把它缩小到最低的条件中，如果它被证明是卑微的，那么就把那真正的卑微全部认识到，并把它的卑微之处公布于世界；或者，如果它是崇高的，就用切身的经历来体会它，在我下一次远游时，也可以作出一个真实的报道。因为，我看，大多数人还确定不了他们的生活是属于魔鬼的，还是属于上帝的呢，然而又多少有点轻率地下了判断，认为人生的主要目标是“归荣耀于神，并永远从神那里得到喜悦”。（徐迟译）</p><h3><span id="wo-men-nei-xin-de-chong-tu">我们内心的冲突</span><a href="#wo-men-nei-xin-de-chong-tu" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>有意识地去体验痛苦，虽然令人痛苦，却可以成为一项非常宝贵的资本。我们越去面对冲突，越去寻求自己的解决途径，我们的内心就越自由，越能得到更多的力量。唯有我们自愿去接受正面冲击时，才可能接近我们的理想，做自己人生的船长。而那种由内心迟钝而带来的，形是而实非的所谓安宁，根本不值得羡慕，它会使我们变弱，使我们轻易沦为太多影响的牺牲品。(卡尔·霍尼)</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>前言：上一次看指环王三部曲还是初中刚毕业的暑假，那时的我尚且不知道世界的基本概念，连自己也不甚了解。在那时看来，指环王不过是一部经典的好莱坞式电影，有着华丽的场景和英勇的主人公们。</p><p>第一印象太容易误导人了。初中时看我以为弗罗多是很惨的主角，被迫接受了一个根本不在自己责任范围内的任务；阿拉贡是个闲散的江湖人士，因为血缘继承王位还娶了精灵作为妻子；弗罗多的伙伴则是不务正业的小混混，只会嬉笑打闹；莱格拉斯像是个外出游历的贵公子；甘道夫刚开始很弱，后来变成白袍巫师后很强；咕噜是个总喜欢说&quot;my precious&quot;的怪物…其他的角色就没有太深的印象了。</p><p>事实上，指环王里的人物每个都有自己的内在精神，他们遇到问题的挣扎和行动映射出了现实的复杂。小时候只知道好人和坏人，黑与白，但现实远比此复杂。有时候正是一些在模糊不清的东西上的选择塑造了一个人的样子。</p><h2><span id="xiao-ren-wu-de-ze-ren">小人物的责任</span><a href="#xiao-ren-wu-de-ze-ren" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>弗罗多是我误解最深的人物，他的存在表示即使是小人物也可以承担责任，也能够改变现实。他并不是从一开始就决意要承担魔戒的责任，只是因为答应了甘道夫要将戒指带到跃马酒店给他而坚定地执行了这个任务，即使遇到了戒灵穷追不舍的刺杀。而他在戒灵的剑下侥幸得存后，在精灵，矮人，人类，巫师等种族争论魔戒的归属时挺身而出，主动承担了将魔戒送往发源地魔多摧毁的任务，即使他甚至不知道魔多在哪儿。</p><p>而没有萨姆就没有弗罗多。前往魔多的旅程是如此困难和孤独，尽管弗罗多在旅程的最后决定自己一个人继续前行，萨姆仍然不离不弃。在魔戒的暗暗影响和咕噜的挑拨离间中，弗罗多能够活着不能缺少萨姆坚定的支持，即使在弗罗多因误解而勒令萨姆离开后。</p><p>梅里和皮平这对活宝也在乱世中承担起了自己的责任。他们在讨论中意识到如果不能够打败魔多和萨鲁曼，那么他们的家乡——夏尔——也将不复存在。所谓的回到夏尔只是一个遥远的梦，而兽人的铁骑正在肆虐这片土地。因此他们才能让本来不想开战的树人意识到这场战争的不可避免。每个人在这样混乱的局面中都被裹挟着，他们也只能面对现实，无论这现实多么残酷痛苦。</p><p>咕噜则显得悲情了很多。咕噜就如同我们自己，他本来只是个普通人，没能抵抗住魔戒的诱惑杀了人后过着离群索居的生活，被魔戒折磨成了一个没有正常生活的怪物。我大概能够理解魔戒对咕噜的诱惑，那些遥远的美好的梦仿佛只要不停地去想这个梦就会变成现实，或许魔戒对咕噜的诱惑就是表示着他失去的生活的补偿。但是原本就不是我们所想要的，即使它再好又和我们有什么关系呢？</p><h2><span id="xin-nian-he-xing-dong">信念和行动</span><a href="#xin-nian-he-xing-dong" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><blockquote><p>You shall not pass!</p></blockquote><p>甘道夫和炎魔的战斗的精彩不在于打斗的绚丽，而是甘道夫其实论实力应该是不及炎魔的，但仍然在阻挡炎魔时站在了最前面。在指环王中这样的场景并不少见，因为有坚定的信念，尽管自己算不上强，但仍然要勉力一试。阿拉贡在最后带领人类军队主动出击像魔多宣战不是因为打赢了刚铎的战役而趁胜追击，而是在兵力不足远小于魔多驻扎的半兽人军队时为了给弗罗多争取时间。坚定的信念让他们在遇到艰难的抉择时不一定做出了正确的行动，但是让他们做出了听从了内心选择的行动。</p><p>我认为能听到内心的声音是很难得的事情。我曾经独处了三年，从来没有听到过内心的声音，不知道自己想要什么，一些所谓的考上某所大学不过是空虚的口号，根本不能够支撑起当下。到现在我也只听到过两次内心的声音。第一次是第一次高考结束我告诉自己&quot;I’m better than this&quot;，然后跑去了复读。还有一次就是现在徘徊着的声音“你在干什么”。我相信如果不把课程计划扎实地学完，这个声音将不会停止。</p><h2><span id="wan-wu-sheng-ling">万物生灵</span><a href="#wan-wu-sheng-ling" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>中土世界滋养里各种各样的生灵，和甘道夫交好的🦅鹰族，迷雾森林里的大蜘蛛，被萨鲁曼砍倒的巨树，通人性的马🐎，魔王的爪牙乌鸦，精灵领地上的溪流…我最喜欢还是树人，恩特人平时深居简出，隐藏在森林深处；在关键时刻才会聚集起来，开一天的会说早上好，然后继续开会。感觉电影里的Treebeard很可爱，偷偷观察梅里和皮平抽烟，打招呼的样子也很特别。</p><h2><span id="hou-ji">后记</span><a href="#hou-ji" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><p>有时间还是得读一遍原著的。真希望熬过这段最艰难的时间。</p>]]></content>

X先生从小学起就追求完美主义，他要上最好的中学所以在小学时就非常努力。当他去了最好的中学，他高兴了两周，然后又变得忧虑，这样还不够，他要上最好的大学，于是在中学时他参加各种课外活动，同时在学业成绩上的表现也非常好。当他去了最好的大学，他高兴了两个月，可以歇歇了么？不行，他需要有一份最好的工作，于是他积极参与课外互动，参加领导了三个社团，同时还参加了一个大公司的实习，这样总该休息了吧？X先生始终有一个更完美的目标需要完成，即使他能够短暂地休息两个月，两周，他总会回到那种焦虑失望的状态。在他老的时候，别人问了他一个问题：你想要的生活是什么样的？</p><p>完美主义导致的结果是：他总是只有暂时的轻松解脱；只能看到不可避免的失败；把发生的一些状况外的杂事看成浪费时间；有出现混乱/病症的倾向。由于只看到了失败，他的自尊受到打击，不再相信自己。而这会进一步影响他的人际关系，引起他的焦虑和压力和痛苦。</p><p>追求excellence的结果是：他总是有能够持续的满足感；对比不可避免的失败，他看到的是成功的可能性；对比看成浪费时间的杂事，他看到的是恰当的时间分配；他对焦虑和失落有健康的方法去解决。他看的是持续的改善和变化，而这时他能够成长。虽然他也会遇到焦虑紧张，但这变得可以控制。更少的痛苦同时更多的收益。</p><h3><span id="sources-of-perfectionism">Sources of Perfectionism</span><a href="#sources-of-perfectionism" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><blockquote><p>Destination = Reward = Acceptance</p><p>Journey = Unrewarded = Means Only</p></blockquote><p>完美主义的起源时永远只能看到目标，奖励结果。社会环境就是如此，只奖励成功的人。</p><p>但我们应该看到过程和结果，奖励过程，尽管有时失败了。顺应自己的天性，允许自己犯错，接纳自己的失败。</p><h3><span id="overcoming-perfectionism">Overcoming Perfectionism</span><a href="#overcoming-perfectionism" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p><u>problem:</u> how to overcome this: living in the future, being afraid of the present because what if I fail?</p><ol><li><p>being aware of what I want to change? and what I want to maintain?</p></li><li><p>rewarding effort</p></li><li><p>Active acceptance</p><p>误区：用完美主义的方式解决完美主义的问题。</p><p>it’s ok to prone to perfection.</p><p>Accept it, then go ahead and change it</p></li><li><p>Behavior:open to criticism</p><p>putting myself on the line</p></li><li><p>Visualization: 想象自己像追求卓越的人一样行动</p></li><li><p>rough draft: Setting a liberating goal or vision</p><p>例子：直到我写出绝世佳作，其他的是草稿。</p><p>例子：20年后我会到最顶尖的学府教授积极心理学，在那之前都是准备。</p><p>解放自己，享受当下。重点是舍弃当下这种吹毛求疵，完美无缺的生活。</p></li><li><p>The Platinum Rule: have compassion for ourselves</p><p>accepting failures in the same way thatwe accept in others, in people we love.</p></li><li><p>how to help others?</p><p>改变不是从一夜就能完成的。</p><ul><li>By example: people do what you do, not what you say.</li><li>Tell stories about it.</li><li>Rewarding the journey/process/effort</li></ul></li></ol><p><u>Technique:</u></p><p>当面临生活的艰难时刻时，受到焦虑挫折打击时，</p><ol><li><p>Permission</p><ul><li><p>Acceptance</p></li><li><p>Respect for reality</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Positive: reframing question: what is the growth opportunity here?</p><ul><li><p>Benefit finding</p></li><li><p>Failure as opportunity:See the opportunity in failures.</p></li><li><p>Distracting</p><p>分散注意力是说当一种想法或感觉反复出现，而我们也与之做着西西弗斯式的对抗时。在这种情况下沉思反而会在同一种思路里越陷越深，得不到什么结果，同时又让人崩溃。最好的方法是分散自己的注意力。当被焦虑压垮的时候，用其他的事情分散注意力，跑步，听音乐，或者做别的。这和逃避问题不同，逃避是指之后不会再处理生活中的任何问题。</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Perspective</p><ul><li><p>Don’t sweat the small stuff… 别为小事抓狂。</p><p>olc: 比如我差点因为翘课被辅导员约谈。</p></li><li><p>Psychological maturity: willingly to shift perspective</p><blockquote><p>It’s the ability, when we want, to be immersed in the here and now in the present.

I’m familiar with that feeling of dwelling on past failures and not seeing the future. The course reminds me of I should see the positive side of problems and take actions after a right amount of time to feel bad about everything. The difference between active agent and passive victim is that active agent is always to make active move like to take active participation in course when you only write contents you understand or feel interested. Whereas the passive victims would feel sorry for themselves and start to complain about everything in life.</p><p>active participation: 不只是这节课，所有课程都该如此。学习不是教条主义，不是容纳而是理解，选择与接受。</p><p><u>problem</u>: If I don’t have much time, what I want to do?</p><ul><li>olc: the answer is finishing the course plan, design and implement useful things in my internship if there’s any.</li></ul><h4><span id="1-focus-on-what-works">1. focus on what works</span><a href="#1-focus-on-what-works" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h4><p>Nature inclination: what I’m good at?

class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>人人都有矛盾。根据矛盾做出决策的前提是对自己观念的清楚认知和意识到冲突时做出选择和为选择承担责任的意愿和能力。</p><p>神经症患者：指达到病态程度的人，对自己情感和愿望的意识非常弱，唯一能清晰体验到的情感就是恐惧和愤怒。在强迫性倾向的控制下，患者失去了决定方向，放弃决定和承担责任的能力。</p><p>神经症冲突使人痛苦的原因：它们难以识别，具有足够的破坏性。</p><p>为应对环境所采取的基本行动：亲近人，对抗人，回避人。分别反映了焦虑的某一个元素：无助，敌意，孤立。三种倾向必定都会出现。我们看到的只是其中占主导地位的倾向。正常人和神经症患者的区别在于这三种态度是否互相排斥。</p><blockquote><p>它的动力核心就是三种态度之间的基本冲突，即“亲近人”“对抗人”和“回避人”。患者一方面害怕自己出现分裂，另一方面又必须作为一个整体发挥功能，所以他便不顾一切地尝试处理冲突。尽管他可以制造出一种人为的平衡，但新的冲突不断产生，并不断要求采取进一步的补救措施。在这场追求整体性的斗争中，每一步都使神经症患者变得更加敌对，更加绝望，更加恐惧，更加疏远自己和他人。其结果便是，这些冲突造成的困难越来越多，真正的解决办法却越来越少。患者最终变得绝望，就试图在施虐行为中寻求补偿，而这反过来又增加了他的绝望，产生了新的冲突。</p></blockquote><p>这些态度从人际关系渗透到整个人格中，最终不仅支配着患者与别人的关系，而且控制着他与自己和整个生活的关系。</p><blockquote><p>冲突开始于我们与别人的关系，最终会影响我们的整个人格，这并不是偶然的。人际关系重要到能够塑造我们发展的品质，影响我们设定的目标，引导我们信仰的价值观。而 所有这一切，反过来又会作用于我们与别人的关系，它们是不可分割地交织在一起的。</p></blockquote><p>神经症的核心：由不相容的态度产生的冲突。神经症是人际关系紊乱的一种表现。</p><h3><span id="si-chong-chang-shi">四种尝试</span><a href="#si-chong-chang-shi" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><blockquote><p>第一种尝试是掩盖某一 部分冲突，并使其对立面占据主导地位。第二种尝试是“回避人”。我们现在对神经症孤 僻的功能有了新的认识。孤僻是基本冲突的一部分，也是一种对待别人的原始的矛盾态度；它同时也表现出处理冲突的意图，在自我和他人之间保持情感距离，使冲突停止运作。第 三种尝试在性质上有很大不同。神经症患者没有“回避人”，而是回避他自己。他的整个 现实自我在某种程度上对他来说是不真实的，他创造了一个理想化的自我形象来取代真实自我。在这个理想化的形象中，相互冲突的部分得到了美化，冲突不再表现为冲突，而像是一个丰富人格中的各个方面。这一概念帮助我们澄清了许多迄今为止无法理解并因此无 法治疗的神经症问题。它也使得起初难以融合的两种神经症倾向各归其位。现在看来，对完美的需求似乎就是患者为了达到这个理想化形象而做出的努力；而对被赞美的渴求可以 看作患者需要外界肯定他和他的理想化形象是一致的。从逻辑上讲，这种形象与现实的差 距越大，患者的需求就越难以满足。在所有处理冲突的尝试中，这种理想化的形象可能是最重要的，因为它对整个人格有着深远的影响。但反过来，它又产生了新的内心裂痕，因此需要进一步的修补。第四种尝试主要是为了消除这一裂痕，它也顺带消除了其他的冲突。通过我所称作的“外化作用”，患者在自我之外所发生的事件中体验他的内心活动。如果 说理想化形象意味着与真实自我只有一步之遥，那么外化作用则代表了与真实自我的彻底 叛离。它再次制造了新的冲突，或者更确切地说，大大增强了原有的冲突，即自我和外界之间的冲突。</p></blockquote><h3><span id="hui-bi-ren">回避人</span><a href="#hui-bi-ren" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>首先要意识到神经症性质的孤僻和儒家思想中的的独处的区别。只有在人际交往中出现了无法忍受的紧张，独处变成主要的逃避手段时，独处才是神经症孤僻的表现。</p><p>严重孤僻的人的表现：对别人的普遍疏远；与自我的疏远，对情感体验的麻木，对自己是谁，对自己的爱，恨，欲望，希望，恐惧，怨恨，信仰的不确定；他们内心需要与自己，与别人保持情感距离。</p><blockquote><p>他们对自己都持“旁观者”态度，一如他们对待生活的态度。他们往往是自己内心活动的出色观察员。一个突出的例子就是，他们经常对梦中的象征表现出惊人的理解力。</p></blockquote><p>孤僻型患者的需要：</p><ul><li><p>主要需求：不参与。表现的特征为对独立的需要。能做的事情不能做的事情都倾向于自己独立完成，永远不对任何人和事产生强烈的依恋以至其不可或缺。</p></li><li><p>其它需要：保护自己隐私；</p></li></ul><p>优越感，孤僻和优越的联系在于-&gt;如果不是真的特别强大和足智多谋，或者感觉自己出类拔萃，恐怕没有人能够忍受孤立。</p><p>孤僻者对优越感需求的独特性在于他讨厌竞争，不愿意付出努力去超越别人；另一种表现为他认为自己是独一无二的，拒不接受任何外来因素。</p><p>我认为这两点是我15岁开始停滞不前的主要原因，too young too naïve，少时自我没有太多内容，更多的只是一些浅显的概念。而由于对外在陌生环境的惧怕和无所适从，以及对这种不适应的掩饰逐步影响到人际关系。</p><blockquote><p>当孤僻型患者的优越感被暂时粉碎时，无论是因为具体的失败还是内心冲突的加剧，他都无法再去忍受孤独，而会疯狂地寻求关爱和保护。这种动荡在他的人生历程中会经常出现。在他十几岁或二十出头的时候，他可能有过一些不冷不热的友谊，但总体上过着相对孤立的生活，感觉自由自在。他经常幻想未来，自己会成就非凡的事业。但后来，这些梦想在现实的岩石上摔得粉碎。尽管在高中时，他无可争辩的是第一名，但在大学，他遇到了激烈的竞争并被击败。他的第一次恋爱也失败了。或者，随着年龄的增长，他意识到自己的梦想是难以实现的。然后，孤独离群变得令他难以忍受；在某种强迫性力量的驱动下，他开始渴求亲密关系、性关系以及婚姻。只要有人爱他，他宁愿卑躬屈膝。</p></blockquote><p>我认为自己确实存在与别人保持情感距离，以避免冲突或更加亲密；也确实希望尽可能单凭理性解决问题。可我不认为这种状态是不可改变的，最多只是在现在这一人生阶段持续着，也有可能因为某人或某事改变。不过这应该也属于作者对孤僻症患者有固有的情感倾向的范畴。作者说的孤僻者对独立有歇斯底里的态度，为此可做出任何牺牲，可以抛弃全部外在利益和内在价值。我对独立没有到这一极端的程度，独立和依赖在我看来也不是非此即彼的关系。这需要因人（所对待的人）而宜。</p><p>Update: 这段话即使是现在看也仍然很令人警醒。虽然我应该不是孤僻者，也没有优越感🙂️。</p><blockquote><p>孤僻型患者的情感生活并不像其他类型那样遵循严格的模式。这一类型的个体差异较大，主要是因为不同于其他两种类型有着积极的目标——顺从型追求喜欢、亲密和爱，攻击型追求生存、控制和成功——而孤僻型的目标是消极的：他不想参与其中，不需要任何人，不允许别人干涉或影响他。他们的情感状态依赖于在消极框架下形成和发展的特殊欲望，而且只会形成少量固有的倾向。</p></blockquote><p>每种态度都有积极价值。但在神经症的结构中出现并运作时，他们会变得相互排斥。</p><blockquote><p>作为众多创造虚假和谐的神经症方式之一，这是一种通过逃避来处理冲突的尝试。但这不是真正的解决之道，因为患者亲近、控制、利用和超越别人的强迫性需求仍然存在，在思维瘫痪之前，他将持续受其骚扰。最后，只要相互矛盾的价值观继续存在，他就永远不能实现真正的内心平静和自由。</p></blockquote><p>外化作用：通过把问题外化而忽略内心冲突的存在，无法把自己想象成个人生活中的积极推动者。患者与自我的疏远加剧了个人和外部世界之间的冲突。</p><p>虚假和谐：拆东墙补西墙。除非最初导致困难的条件被彻底改变否则就是无效的。</p><p>围绕基本冲突这一核心建立起来的防御机制：称为防护性结构。每种神经症都形成了一套防御系统，包含上述形式，活跃程度不同。</p><h2><span id="wei-jie-jue-chong-tu-de-hou-guo">未解决冲突的后果</span><a href="#wei-jie-jue-chong-tu-de-hou-guo" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h2><h3><span id="kong-ju">恐惧</span><a href="#kong-ju" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><blockquote><p>通过压抑、理想化和外化的过程，患者已经失去了大部分的自我；即使还没有真的变成影子，但他感觉自己就像一个无足轻重、毫无内涵的影子。 与此同时，他对别人的需要和恐惧，不仅使他们更加令人生畏，而且更加不可或缺。</p></blockquote><p>当时浑浑噩噩地白天睡觉，晚上刷剧的原因就是不知道如何面对周围环境的评价，索性采取了漠视的态度。印象比较深的场景时上课睡觉，当时应该在讲卷子我没写，然后被老师抓到了作为反面典型，顺便再评论了一下我之后的人生就只能这样了。</p><blockquote><p>这样做的后果是，患者过度看重别人对他的评价，而自我评价则变得无关紧要。这使得别人的意见对他具有一种压倒性的力量。</p></blockquote><p>虽然尚未到这种程度，但是这样的后果也足够惊骇了。</p><blockquote><p>一般来说，这种恐惧的后果就是使神经症患者远离别人，并对别人产生敌意。更重要的是，这种恐惧使受其折磨的人无法施展自己的才能。他们不敢对别人抱有期望，也不敢为自己设定远大理想。他们不敢接近那些看起来比自己优秀的人；他们不敢发表意见，即使自己可能很有见解；他们不敢运用自己的创造力，即使自己拥有这种能力；他们不敢让自己具有吸引力，不敢试图给人留下深刻印象，也不敢寻求更好的职位，等等。即使有时他们在这些方面跃跃欲试，但想到被人嘲笑的场景便望而却步，退回到自己的矜持和自尊中寻求慰藉。</p></blockquote><p>我想要：</p><blockquote><p>如果我们想要最终获得人格的整合，就必须把自己暴露在恐惧面前，所以它们也是我们直面自己所遇到的障碍。它们如同炼狱，我们必须在那里徘徊，最后才能得到救赎。</p></blockquote><h3><span id="ren-ge-wei-suo">人格萎缩</span><a href="#ren-ge-wei-suo" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p><strong>压抑的部分基本冲突</strong>造成了个人精力的部分消耗。</p><p>造成的主要困扰有：犹豫不决；普遍的效率低下（开车的同时踩刹车）；普遍的惰性。</p><p>未解决的神经症冲突所浪费的精力是无法估量的。</p><blockquote><p>神经症患者可能认为，必须不懈地努力这一事实让他感到羞辱，这无异于表示他 不是他的理想化形象；一想到要付出世俗的努力，他宁愿什么也不做，整天在幻想中大展拳脚。自卑的折磨伴随着理想化形象，剥夺了他的自信，让他觉得自己做不了任何有价值的事，从而把所有的动力和乐趣都埋在流沙里。</p></blockquote><p>理想</p><blockquote><p>我断言他并没有认真对待自己的理想，意思是说这些理想对他的生活并没有约束力。当理想很容易实现或很有用的时候，他就会付诸行动，一旦时过境迁，他便束之高阁。而对认真对待理想的人来说，这种情况是很难想象的。<strong>如果这些理想是真实的，他们不可能轻易将其抛到一边。</strong></p></blockquote><p>责任</p><blockquote><p>我们说的承担责任，是指能够为我们认为正确的事情挺身而出，而且当我们的 行动或决定被证明是错误时，能够承担后果。</p></blockquote><h3><span id="jue-wang">绝望</span><a href="#jue-wang" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>注解说绝望来自于无法成为自己。我的程度应该没有这么深，丧是肯定的，但只有某些时刻才会有这样的感觉。15-16时存在某种理想化形象，不过就算是那个时候也是极其浅显的认知，衍生了很多无谓的幻想。不过我认为这种情况很难避免，由于对环境的不够完全的认知，个人又丢失了基本的行动力，停停走走，直到这个状态彻底不能维持下去。</p><blockquote><p>不仅如此，日常生活中的小意外在他头脑中都犹如大难临头。任何微小的失败都可能 使他陷入抑郁，因为这证明了他毫无价值——即使失败是由不可控的因素造成的。任何无伤大雅的批评都可能使他忧心忡忡或前思后想，如此等等。结果，他比一般人更不快乐、 更不满意，这当然是庸人自扰。</p></blockquote><p>绝望者的态度</p><blockquote><p>生命是一种永恒的负担，他们见怪不怪，也没有什么抱怨。但是，他们的情绪永远都 处于低谷的状态。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>他一直处于自己极不满意的情境中，或许只要付出一点努力，拿出一点积极性，这种状况就可以得到改善。但是，他可能因为绝望而完全瘫痪，对他而言，正常的困难似乎都是不可逾越的障碍。</p></blockquote><p>从对待绝望态度到对待神经症态度：<br>绝望由内心冲突引起。这种境况十分困难，但真正使事情变得绝望的是患者态度。</p><blockquote><p>假如提供建议的是一 位优秀的分析师，他会说：“当然，这种境况十分困难。但真正使事情变得绝望的是你们 自己的态度。如果你们考虑改变自己对生活的要求，就不会再感到绝望了。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>我认为神经症的强迫性倾向并非出自本能，而是来自人际关系的紊乱；当患者的人际关系得到改善时，这些倾向是可以改变的，发源于此的冲突也可以真正得到解决。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>尽管每次遇到问题都必须从头处理，但只要患者认识到他真的可以改变，绝望对他的控制就会有所松动，他的动力也会随之增强。<strong>在分析开始时，这种动力可能仅限于他希望摆脱最令人不安的症状；但是，当患者越来越意识到他的枷锁，尝到了自由的滋味时，他的动力就会越来越强</strong>。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

In example 1, if it needs to preserve a bit-perfect communication, enforcements on the delivery order (low-level reliability measures) causing delay are disruptive. It’s better to receive damaged data and add replacement measures as duplication, noise for better performance. However, some applications like real-time communication require the strong E2E argument.</p><p>In example 2, a storage system is at the receiving end of the voice communciation.

      <title>《暗黑》—— 关于时间问题的另一种陈述</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>跌跌撞撞穿过时空，方向是无止境。飞蛾扑火，就像你和我。随时随地未来随时开始。我不会再等待。爱由勇气而生，所以不要再犹豫。我们踩着炽热的火轮，穿过黑夜驶向未来。</p></blockquote><h3><span id="qian-yan">前言</span><a href="#qian-yan" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>之前就听说过暗黑被称为德国版怪奇物语，虽然我觉得怪奇物语是很不错的故事，但不确定自己能不能看完整整三季冗长的叙述，就没有立即去看。然后第一个场景和片头就让我感觉这会成为我最喜欢的剧，一个双目被侵蚀的人从时间裂缝中掉出来，一个窄小的地下室，两三个人在讨论如何处理。片头初见只是简单的对称图形，越看越觉得这应该是分形的结构，有一种几何美。配乐也非常空灵。</p><p>为什么要写这篇文章呢？我想梳理一下对这部剧的想法，尝试联系之前看过的类似题材，更重要的是问自己一些问题。有时候觉得自己是很矛盾的人，既追求实用主义，又向往无用之学。比如对生科强烈地排斥态度就由于生科所研究的东西我都不能理解和日常生活有什么太大联系，实验包含很多重复实验而往往重做的时间又很长，这些都是我后来发现的一些理想和现实的差距。另一方面，我又很爱看一些科幻历史题材，也会看感兴趣的哲学类话题。喜欢计算机也是因为它既有用也无用，现在也只是想完成最开始设定的6-3的主干课程，群里的小伙伴已经去实习和刷题准备秋招了，而我还待在学校一事无成。</p><p>如果不能感受生活的乐趣，那么这生活——我们所努力去做的事情——还有什么意义呢？我也有自己的路要走。</p><h3><span id="qiang-lie-de-hui-xiang">强烈的回响</span><a href="#qiang-lie-de-hui-xiang" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>《暗黑》在故事开头就有一种强烈的即视感。时间线因为某个关键节点的改变产生新的时间线，各种人物关系，利益团体交错复杂，主角为了改变这所谓的宿命在不同时间来回跳跃，最后终于使时间线收敛，这是石头门所讲的部分。又或者是一个闭环的故事，一个完整的圆形循环，其中的节点有特定的人去完成，周而复始，这是阿西莫夫《永恒的终结》所讲述的。暗黑虽然被称为德国版怪奇物语，但和怪奇物语是完全不同的故事，最多也就是视觉效果上都比较暗沉。和谐的音乐和剪辑，一环扣一环的剧情展开，讲述了一个结♾️的展开和消失归于黑暗的故事。</p><h3><span id="jiao-du-bian-hua">角度变化</span><a href="#jiao-du-bian-hua" class="header-anchor">¶</a></h3><p>我很少会在看剧的时候有认知在不断变化和加深的经历，感受不到太多明显的层次。然而在暗黑的整个过程中我都处于惊讶状态，常常是我觉得我懂了然后下一集又推翻了这个想法。在刚开始我以为三个世界是以年代划分的，1986，1999，1953构成了三个世界代表现在未来过去，通过唯一的洞穴充当虫洞连接起不同的时空。故事是一个循环进行的环形叙事，故事的开始就是结尾，结尾就是开始。然而即使是最简单的图形通过一点变换就能变成不同的样子。正如一个圆镜像对称了另一个圆，构成了无限的符号。一个世界镜像了另一个平行世界，而这两个世界通过男主女主连接成一个不破的结，所有节点上的事情按部就班地发生，每个人的命运在最开始就已经写好，即使他/她总有错觉在这一次循环里能够打破这个结。</p><p>印象深刻的一个情节是，新派来的警长在面对小镇群众对前任警方负责人无法解决青少年失踪案仍参与调查时说，一个大象十个人去看会得到十种不同的样子，但如果一个人用十种角度去看，根据不同的结果进行修正往往就能得到对大象正确的认知。暗黑不断追问的问题“起源在哪里”纠缠了所有人无尽个循环，Jonus(Adam)每次循环里都认为自己不会成为老年时期Adam麻木残酷的样子，只要自己在某件事做了不同的决定，就能打破这次循环，但最后只是一次次地走向固定的命运。Martha(eve)为了延续因旧世界Martha死去而创造出的新世界，不断引导年轻时的自己走向循环的不同方向，以存续这个结和两个世界。他们沉浸在自己的视角里太久，观者也沉浸在自己的视角里走不出来。</p><p>两个世界只是起源世界的分支，它们在诞生时就摧毁了起源世界，并成为回环往复的衔尾蛇，所有人自此困顿在时间的囚牢里。而只有从最开始改变起源，阻止时间机器的产生，才能避免这个结，让世界正常单线进行。代价就是两个世界不复存在，曾经奋斗的一切化为虚无，而结以外的人还能在起源世界活下去。Claudia提供了第三种角度，她为了拯救女儿必死的命运来往于两个世界，在不同的时空通过改变不同角色的行为观察导致的结果，在每次循环里提供给新循环里的自己新的认知，当碎片被收集完全，才得到了追寻的答案。</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to be here today. It’s really such an honor for me to be back at MIT and to really participate in today’s hooding ceremony. And I have to say a big, hearty congratulations to all of you who are graduating this week. I know just how hard you’ve worked for this achievement, and it’s an honor to be here to recognize you today. And also, to all of the friends and family who have supported our graduates this week, congratulations to you as well. Everyone here should feel extremely proud of this amazing accomplishment.</p><p>Now I heard a very insightful comment once that really stuck with me. And it was really that the two most important things that determines a person’s success in life is really the love of their family and their education. And I certainly believe that. As I think back to my days at MIT, I am incredibly grateful for the experiences that I had here and the things that I learned. And if you will indulge me for a few minutes, let me tell you a little bit about my story. So I was born in Taiwan, and I came to the United States when I was two, and I grew up in New York to immigrant parents. I was very lucky to have parents that supported me as I grew up, and really treating my brother and I as equals and <strong>setting extremely high standards for what success meant.</strong></p><p>Throughout grade school and middle school, I was an OK student, but I certainly wasn’t anywhere near best in my class. I did realize, though, that competition made me better. So in high school I went to the Bronx High School of Science, and I met some very smart people, and some of them were pretty competitive. And that pushed me harder and shaped my interests in math and science. Then I was lucky enough to get into MIT as an undergrad, and I truly understood what smart was. I think you guys understand that, too. Freshman year at MIT was actually very eye opening. And I would say it was pretty intimidating taking some of those freshmen weed out classes that we know exist at the Institute.</p><p>However, it was during my freshman year at MIT that I got my first undergraduate research assignment, and it was in a semiconductor lab. And I had the opportunity for the first time to do something that I thought was amazing. I fell in love with semiconductors because it was the ability to build something really small and really complicated, and I could do it myself. And it was during this time that I realized that I didn’t need to be the smartest person in the classroom, but if I really applied myself to solve practical problems, I could make a big difference. And so as I was graduating from the 6-A program at MIT, my parents encouraged me to get a PhD. I actually really wasn’t sure that this is what I wanted to do, but I was really too young you know at the time to know any better, so I said-- some of you might relate to that-- but I said, OK, you know, I’ll do it. But I was really torn with the prospect of spending another four to five years of my life in school.</p><p>Now I can honestly say that the MIT PhD has truly shaped who I am in so many ways, both personally and professionally. And so when people ask me what has MIT meant to me, I usually say a couple of things. I say MIT is pure, and it’s really hard. I do believe that MIT practices the motto what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Hope you guys agree with that. But what I really say, though, is that MIT taught me how to think and solve really tough problems because today, for all of you who are completing your doctoral dissertations, you have created something or discovered something or demonstrated something that nobody else in the world has. And that should give you an incredible amount of confidence about what you’re able to do when you put your mind to it. And through that you’ve really proven that you’re at the top of your field, and so you should feel extremely proud of that accomplishment.</p><p>So my path since leaving MIT has had a few twists and turns, and I find myself often coming back to the principles that I learned here. So as each of you sit here today, about to embark on your own journey, I have maybe just a couple of small pieces of advice that I would like to share with you.</p><p>The first-- and I’ll say this is, you should really <strong>dream big</strong>. Believe that you can change the world. I remember when I first left MIT,I was really intimidated about joining a large corporate environment I was 25 years old and I joined IBM’s TJ Watson Research Center, which had an incredible reputation. And I met people who had a lot more experience and knowledge than I had. And I had no idea how could I contribute in that environment and make a difference. However, what I learned is that MIT has really prepared you for that journey. MIT trains the best problem solvers in the world, and the world is starving for new ideas and great leaders who will champion those ideas. So I was able to make a difference even after a few short months, and each of you will make an incredible difference as well. You are the next generation of great leaders with fresh, innovative ideas, and you will solve the world’s toughest problems. You just have to believe in yourself and give yourself the permission to believe that you can change the world.</p><p>Second, I would say have the courage to <strong>take risks</strong>, sometimes big risks. But make sure you also enthusiastically learn from your mistakes. And there will be a few mistakes. I started off as an engineer and then turned to the business and management side of things in my career. And I saw, actually, in many business environments, that MIT PhDs worked for Harvard MBAs. And the truth is, that made absolutely no sense to me.[appLAUSE]I was determined to make sure that I wasn’t working for Harvard MBAs for the rest of my career. But truthfully, I actually thought I could make better business decisions because I understood the technology, whereas sometimes generalists don’t.[appLAUSE]So I took a risk, and I asked my management at IBM to give me a chance to run a business. And they did actually give me a shot, surprisingly. I made a lot of mistakes those first few years, and I learned that the moments that really shaped my career were the times when I really screwed up the most. It’s like in the lab, you know, when that experiment you thought was supposed to work out didn’t quite work out, you know, what do you do? You need to learn and adjust your next steps. It’s certainly like that in your career, as well. And sometimes you even make some very large mistakes. Like for example, the first business ran, I missed my revenue the first year by 50%.My boss wasn’t very happy about that. I spent about 24 hours being extremely disappointed in myself, but the day after, I promised myself I would learn from it. And I adjusted my game plan for the rest of the year. And you can believe I never made that particular mistake again. And so I really do say, don’t be afraid to take risks, even if some of them seem large, and don’t be afraid to make a few mistakes. Mistakes are natural. There’s no straight line to success. But the people who learn best from their mistakes are actually the ones who end up being the best leaders.</p><p>And the last thing I want to leave you with is perhaps most important. I encourage each of you to <strong>make your own luck</strong>. MIT has given you all the tools and training to be the best in the world and make a huge impact on your chosen field. However, in addition to being smart, you also have to be lucky, and <strong>you have to be in the right place at the right time solving the right problems.</strong> So my favorite advice to graduates is find the toughest problems in the world and volunteer to help solve them because this is really how you make your own luck. This is when people really pay attention. And this is when you’re really doing something that makes a difference. I’ve had the opportunity several times in my career to work on some very hard problems. Sometimes I found it extremely frustrating and stressful. But each time, I found that working on something hard brought out the best in me and also my team. And it also created a new set of opportunities. So five years ago I had the opportunity to join AMD. Now when I joined AMD, there were a few of my mentors who actually questioned my decision because they knew about the challenges of the company. And I actually looked at them really perplexed. I actually felt like I could not possibly have a better opportunity because I had trained my entire career, since my days at MIT through my 20 years in industry, to lead a semiconductor company. And so this was my opportunity to make my own luck.</p><p>The world is full of very complex and challenging problems. And I truly believe that what MIT has taught us is that <strong>there is no problem that is too hard to solve if you have the right mindset, the right perseverance, and the right creativity.</strong> So I advise you to run towards those problems, and you will have great luck throughout your career. So today is a tremendous day for all of you. It really is a celebration of your MIT experience, but it’s also a celebration of the beginning of the next chapter in your career, where you start to leverage all of the tools and training you’ve received here to go off and solve the world’s hardest problems and make the world a better place. <strong>So I encourage each of you to dream big and believe you can change the world, have the courage to take risks and enthusiastically learn from those mistakes, and work damn hard every day to solve the world’s toughest problems.</strong> And I think if you do that, I’m pretty sure you’re going to make everybody very proud, and you will be incredibly lucky throughout your career. So I do have one last personal request for all of you. You know, I told you at the beginning that I’m slightly competitive, just slightly. So please promise me that you will join me on my journey to make sure that there are lots of Harvard MBAs working for MIT PhDs in the future. Thank you very much and congratulations.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Star wars和Star Trek 系列一样作为生活大爆炸主角的爱好，我早就有所耳闻。但是我之前一直以为只有geek才会喜欢这种类型的，一直没有看。直到偶然看到星球大战：残次品，动画效果展现出的宇宙有一种真实的浩瀚感，而故事也很有意思。于是我又开始看背景中的克隆人战争，看到中途还补了前传三部曲，正传只是略看了下。</p><p>在全系列中我最喜欢的人物还是阿纳金·天行者。</p><p>阿纳金在小时候就向往走过每一个星球，眼前浩瀚无垠的星空显得神秘而又不可控制。阿纳金一直将亲人的重要性放在任何准则之上，他的母亲，妻子，徒弟是他最重要的人。当他的母亲意外时他杀了绑架她的一整个部族的人，预见妻子会难产而死时又想打破这命运即使因此进入原力的黑暗面成了黑暗尊主的学徒达斯·维达。克隆人战争系列丰满了阿纳金的血肉。他是独特的绝地武士，除了卓越的军事能力和思考问题的灵活性，他有自己所相信的。</p><p>阿纳金的悲剧源于他的性格如此，由环境所推动。他的徒弟阿索卡被诬陷入狱并被剥夺绝地学徒身份，直到他找回证据后绝地委员会也未在此事件上承认过失，只是用绝地的试炼来掩饰曾表现出对阿索卡的不信任。阿纳金对绝地委员会的信任在克隆人战争未结束前就已经一点点的丧失。而在委员会和议长的争斗中，他身为绝地一员却因为议长对他展示出的信任而失去委员会的信任，却要求他充当间谍来监视议长的活动，即使这有违绝地守则。在阿纳金发现了议长的最终身份告知了委员会后，他们仍然将他孤立在抓捕议长的行动之外。他恳求温杜留下议长的性命因为这是唯一拯救妻子生命的机会没有得到温杜的任何回应和解释，于是他也做出了自己的选择。他一直是个决绝人。阿纳金投向黑暗面最初是为了拯救爱人，但在爱人死去和徒弟离开后彻底不能回头。力量让他迷失在对权力的追逐和统治整个银河系的幻想中。</p><p>共和国失去民主然后变成帝国的过程始终有些不可思议，也让我想去了解更多什么才是民主。共和国在克隆人战争未开始时已经由于腐败而在经济，政治，军事等方面暴露出各种弱点，而之后在共和国议会议长帕尔帕廷在暗中操控下，通过和分离势力的战争一步步将权力集中在自己手里，最后独裁帝国成立。虽然绝地委员会表面上是为了阻止最高议长的阴谋而意图在过渡期掌控议会，但绝地制度的僵化和共和国一样难以挽回，他们不允许被挑战权威同时又固执己见，没有解释的空间。新帝国在早期未辜负人民渴望和平的期望，结束了银河系中环和外环的战争。但在权力集中后，强大的军事力量成为了帝国控制各星系的武器，帝国不再需要人民的支持，凭借威慑就能使之臣服，而帝国议会的解散则标志着民主的完全丧失。</p>]]></content>

      <title>《论自由》读书笔记</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>《论自由》一书中论述了公民自由的边界。首先需要确定的原则是社会若要干预个人事务，只有当目的是防止其伤害他人时才能违背其意志而不失正当地施加于他。个人只有有关于他人利害的部分需要对社会负责，只要个人行为仅与自己有关，那么他就无需对社会负责。作者首先正面论证了自由的定义，并对其分支思想言论自由和个人自由的原理展开论述，最后分析了自由原理在社会中的具体应用。我最感兴趣的地方是怎样才算个人自由？当个人表现得与群体大多数不同的时候，社会应当如何对待作为少数群体与大多数表现不同的部分？</p><p>一个人在和社会其他人交互时自然地产生意见和表达意见，并按照自己的意见行动。产生意见，表达意见和行动都属于个人自由的范畴，不应当被社会强制改变。</p><p>文章分别从三个论点论证了思想自由及表达想法的自由对人类精神幸福的必要性。首先权威所压制的意见不一定是错误的。在历史上即使迫害程度有所减轻，对异端者的迫害从未停止并且很少失败。苏格拉底被国人判为不敬神和不道德处以死刑；耶稣背负亵渎神灵的罪名受刑于十字架。况且即使是所在时代拥有一般人难以比拟的判断力和学识的伟人也有出错的可能，正如下令镇压了基督教的人是贤明的古罗马皇帝奥勒留。其次即使这种意见是错误的，禁绝它仍为过错。被压制的意见可能有部分是正确的同时又是当下通行的意见所欠缺的，真理需要经此修正和补足。如果未经过挑战和反对就直接接受真理会使其流于形式，成为一项成见，既不靠论证又不准论证，这样真理则成为了迷信。作者认为人们需要为其信念的正确性提供证明，为自己的观点提供正反两面证明，在不断否定和辩护的过程中理解自己的观点。通过以宗教信条和道德学说的发展史举例，他驳斥了当公认意见为真，缺乏言论自由的危害之处有限的观点。尽管随着社会文明的进步，意见必然统一，但真理需要分歧使人可以为之向对手解释或辩护来获得更新的活力。最后，现实中常出现真理共存于一组相互冲突的信条之间，人们需要做出明智的判断，在各种不同的观点间进行取舍，而不是让一方的偏见压倒另一方。</p><p>那么我们需要怎样的言论自由呢？公共讨论中自由表达的界限在哪里？有人认为，“一切言论固然都应该被允许自由表达，但前提是意见表达方式必须温和节制，不能逾越自由讨论的界限。”为了使双方的观点得到充分表达，限制主流观点使用无节制的谩骂之语的重要性大于以同等要求约束非主流观点。而这种限制需要来自于舆论对实际情况具体分析，而不是来自于法律和权威当局。</p><p>在实际问题中言论自由的考量变得更加复杂。以某个论坛为例，禁言，封号和删帖的标准在哪里？论坛能有不同的声音吗？当某个活跃成员的发言过于激烈冒犯到了部分成员从而累积多次举报后，这个成员被论坛的管理员小组禁言。那么这项处理是否合理呢？这需要进行多方论证其合理性，管理员小组对禁言的标准和论坛的自由表达相关的“不要发表任何理智的人会认为冒犯的、过分的或招致怨恨的言论”的约定再次进行公示并对成员的处理过程公开；同时，受到该成员冒犯的其他成员对为什么感觉到冒犯的问题与支持她应当自由表达个人观点即使语气带有冲突性的成员进行了相互论证；再次，无任何利益关系的第三方成员相对客观地在其中发表了个人观点；当观点发表在论坛上，就能够被反驳或者支持。通过这样一次论坛内的公开讨论，我们虽然不能说明这项处理是绝对合理的，但我们能够认为这是能够保证多数人自由发表言论的合理方案。而对这项处理有反对意见的人仍然有权利做出自己想做出的任何决定，比如删号或者退出。</p><p>思想言论的自由是个性自由的前提，个性的自由表达与发展相关。个性的自由发展造就先进之士，而先进之士拥有的首创力为未进之士打开眼界，从而让他们在眼界完全打开后有机会使自己成为具备首创力的人。这些少数的先进之士“所能要求的，只是为人们指出道路的自由”，而人们有权力也应当去主动选择真正适合自己的道路，而不是盲从盲信于先进之士的道路。</p><blockquote><p>没有理由说一切人类生活都应该被一个或少数几个模型所筑造。如果一个人具备相当的常识和经验，其以自己的方式筹划生活，就是最好的，并非因为这种方式本身就为最好，而是因为这是属于他自己的方式。</p></blockquote><p>虽然个性得到充分发展有利于社会进步和人类多样性，但公众舆论的倾向则往往不能容忍任何显著的个性流露。作者通过东西方文明发展的对比论述了习俗的专制的危害，反面论证了个性自由的价值。中国在很早的时候就发展出世界领先的风俗制度，然而在确保最富智慧的人稳居高位后则陷入了近千年的停滞；反观欧洲之所以能不断进取则是因为各民族的性格与教养异常歧异，这样的分歧造成变化，引导进步。</p><p>现代政体一般是代表大多数人意志的自治政府，然而大多数人的意志并不能等同于全体人民的意志。多数人的暴政可能以难以察觉的方式渗透入个人生活的各方面。除了法律约束，社会中的优势意见和大众情感同样在潜移默化中成为束缚异见者的方式。作为个体，很难在充满反对声音的环境下仍旧坚持个人意见。而经常发生的情况是大多数人的意见取代了个人的。作者认为，每个人都有权利用自己认为善的方式生活。即使大多数人的意见是有利于他的，只要他原本的意见没有伤害到社会其他人，他就有坚持自己想法的自由。“他人可以热心地助其判断，衷心鼓舞他的意志，乃至强行向他进谏，然而是否采纳必须取决于他自己”。而当他的意见伤害到社会中的其他人或有伤害的确定危险，那么就不符合自由原则而应当受道德或法律问责。</p><p>自由原则在现实生活中的具体应用表现得更为复杂。文末通过举了多个例子讨论了个人自由和社会干涉的界限，并且着重论述反对政府干涉即使其所行未侵犯自由的三类理由。自由原则不允许人有放弃自由的自由，也不允许人以任何名义干涉他人的自由。而政府权力应当受到限制，“在不违效率的前提下，尽最大限度地让权力分散；同时由一个集散中枢尽最大可能地让信息得到收集和传播”。</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>我，一个二十岁的潦倒青年，唯一的爱好就是解谜。听闻本市郊区有一座古堡，而主人是一位年逾花甲的老人，他唯一的乐趣就是听各种不同的声音。或许我可以去老人那碰碰运气，看看是否能听到有趣的事情，或者我可以给他讲我解过的谜题。</p><p>当来到这座古堡门下，我就被这尖顶建筑给吓到了，或许是这颜色深褐的玻璃，或许因为这阴暗的氛围，谁能知道诺大的城堡只有那么几盏昏暗的灯？谁能想到我来到这里已经是深夜了？</p><p>管家的及时出现让我镇定下来，我立刻被带到老人面前，“这么晚还没睡？”。老人把看着的书放下，直视我，“告诉我年轻人，你有什么故事？”我，虽然其实并未真正解过什么复杂的谜题，但是我可是好歹也看过几本侦探小说，大不了胡乱编造一些。</p><p>“以时间为谜底的谜题，在博尔赫斯的笔下是不断分叉的花园迷宫。主人公进入其中做出了选择A,他传递出了信息出去但自己因此杀了无辜的人并被绞死；选择不进入逃走为选择B；选择进入但不连累别人为选择C……这无数个选择同时存在因时间上的区别而分叉出无数个枝桠。你知道，这并不是我第一次听到这样的故事。阿西莫夫写的时间的终结里，时间是一条衔尾蛇，终结过后就又回到初始，无限循环，直到有一天循环的某个环节的执行者发现了存在另一个时间节点的自己产生悖论。时间因果论，平行世界说，时间线的收敛，无限♾️与永恒，这些不过是哄骗青年的未知题。”我顿了顿，窗外的夜色掩映下仿佛我正身处一个迷宫“或许这样说并不恰当。”老人只是略皱着眉，示意我继续往下说……</p><p>“思考一个故事的发展，需要考虑背景。我记得特德姜的你一生的故事里的女主人公通过和外星生物的交谈获得了对世界的全新认知，在知道未来，过去和现在中仍旧按着既定轨迹生活着，这并不是因为她对自己不能改变命运而心如死水，而是她从新的角度理解了自己的故事。而我们讨论的故事主人公余淮尽管并未一开始就知道迷宫的存在，却在走进花园迷宫后和艾伯特的交谈中明白了祖先遗留下文字的意义，明白了自己此行既是巧合，也是时间无限分叉中的必然。他杀了艾伯特，后来他又被绞死，再后来他亲自讲述了这个故事。最后这个他或许是某个分岔中的不同时间点存在的余淮对这一选择下后果的窥视，一个能够明白余淮的无限悔恨和厌倦的人正是他自己，一个不存在在现实中的幽灵……”。老人打断了我，“年轻人，我懂你想表达的意思。但让我来问你一个问题，我们为什么要讨论一些看上去没有实际意义而对生活没有改善的东西？没有冒犯的意思，但我注意到你卷曲干燥的头发，穿的有些年月的破旧的深色外套，或许你的生活境况并不好。你今年多少岁？“”二十一，先生，过了十月的话。“我耸耸肩，无所谓地说。</p><p>“因为思考这样的问题能让我思考问题的角度更透彻，对工作和学习也会有帮助。”我停顿了下，“这样的回答您是否满意呢？我想您只会认为我在巧言令色。我想这些问题只不过是因为觉得有趣而已，自由而无用是我所信奉的。而在我看来，您现在愿意听我讲到这里而没把我赶出去，一是因为您和我是相似的人，二是因为您想要听到的不一样的声音既不是实用的，也不是无用的，而是真实的被体验的。”老人与我对视，然后走到窗前。“活到我这样岁数的人，看过很多故事。现实中的，别人写的。空谈无用，我见过很多和你一样年纪的青年讲述自己将要做的事情，仿佛他们已经做成了。但最后能够做成的却是其中能不畏异见坚持的人，能听见的声音终将被听见。不过，人生辗转，最后也不过是归于泥土，为什么要考虑这些现实呢？我之前的问题只是想知道你想从我这里寻求什么，现在我已经知道了。“钟声敲响，已经十二点了。”现在很晚了，你先去休息，明天跟我去一个地方走走。“老人摆摆手。我点头致意，走了出去。管家安排了个房间给我，我却没有丝毫睡意，或许是长时间的步行，或许是刚刚的交谈。</p><p>天上有很多星星，这可不是你在城市里能经常看到的情景。我来这里好像也没什么特殊的目的，听说是个有意思的老头，所以就来了。或许我还要去找一份工作，身上快没钱了，还暂时不想流落街头。断断续续的念头冒出来，仿佛无数条断点连成了一条线，而这条线上写着的就是我人生的记录。我从任何角度上来看都是个随意的人，要说和以前的一点区别大概就是从无欲无求到随心所欲，自由总是有代价的，这一点我不是不明白，但我更想在有限的时间里做点自己喜欢做的事，不管它有没有实际用处。而学院里的事不管多么精彩，都与我无关，魔药学是我最讨厌的一门课，我又不是混血王子，怎么配制出那一个个奇形怪状有着奇怪名字的各式药剂。好在比起低年级我逃课也逃得越理直气壮了，今年更是索性休学了。</p>]]></content>
